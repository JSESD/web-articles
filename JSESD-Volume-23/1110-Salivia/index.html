<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">People who are blind face unique challenges as software developers. Screen reading technology is often unable to adequately represent the complex and dynamic nature of modern application interfaces often used for software development. Complex interfaces make the task of information seeking and retrieval particularly challenging to developers who are blind. Our main goal is to help individuals who are blind with the problem of information retrieval in a non-visual manner from a graphical user interface. We are particularly interested with graphical user interfaces related to software development such as text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs). Information retrieval has been shown to be a prevalent problem amongst individuals who are blind interacting with technology, especially software developers (Mealin &amp; Murphy-Hill, 2012). There are an estimated 19 million software developers worldwide, with an expected increase to at least 25 million by the year 2020 (Evans Data Corporation, 2014). Out of the plethora of software developers, we do not know exactly how many of them are blind or visually impaired. However, according to a survey conducted by Stack Overflow, a prominent software development resource website, more than 600 respondents identified as blind (Stack Overflow, 2017).
</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Modern software development tools are quite different from those used in years past. Today, IDEs provide highly dynamic, rich interfaces for developers. These interfaces facilitate productivity through their extensive visualization capabilities and organizational display of content. This augments the complexity of the information retrieval problem, because these interfaces provide information contextually via visual cues, which are clearly not specifically designed for individuals who are blind and may not work with existing accessibility tools such as screen readers. Therefore, those who are blind or visually impaired often find IDEs to be challenging to work with, and in many situations completely unusable even with the use of screen reading technology (Lazar, Allen, Kleinman, &amp; Malarkey, 2007).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In our work, we explore the use of Braille as a possible option to improve accessibility for software developers who are blind. One reason we concentrate on Braille as an option is based on reports by the American Printing House for the Blind. Out of their 27,212 student members currently enrolled in elementary through post-secondary education, 3,781 considered Braille to be their primary reading medium (American Printing House for the Blind, 2013). When we look at the intersection between software developers and users of Braille, we see that there is a big potential for Braille-based user interfaces to aid with information retrieval. Half of the participants in a study by Mealin and Murphy-Hill (2012) reported using a Braille display for software development. Furthermore, though Braille is introduced early in education, we have not seen recent work on developing more effective use of Braille when interacting with computers.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In this work, we develop a software add-on to an educational programming tool used in a university course to add functionality that provides a Braille user with enhanced ability to locate information and interact with the user interface. A developer is usually aware of the information they need to find. For developers who are not blind, IDEs provide information contextually via visual cues and layout allowing the developer to visually locate desired information while simultaneously ignoring less important content. On the other hand, users who are blind make use of proxies such as the cursor to navigate the information that is displayed. A contextual layout of information does not help a user who is blind because he or she would have to navigate away from the current position to find the relevant information, and then relocate to their previous focus manually. Our software allows the user to specify contextual information from the visual user interface (UI) that will be displayed in Braille regardless of where the user’s cursor is positioned, thus facilitating information retrieval. Additionally, the software assists the developer with parsing complex data structures represented in code that are very difficult to interpret with speech alone.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">We perform a user experience study to measure the subjective and objective change in our student participant’s performance while interacting with an IDE which is part of a learning tool that utilizes the Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages CPU architecture (MIPS). By assisting with information retrieval, we expect that our method will improve student developers’ abilities to complete tasks in a reasonable time and improve their experience while working in development environments.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">RELATED WORK</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Historically, computer interfaces were largely character-based. When display devices were developed, the interface presented on screen was linear, textual, and command based. When computer interfaces were text-based, users who are blind found that they were able to access and use computers at roughly the same performance level as their sighted peers (Alexander, 1998). Speech synthesis technology provided auditory access to the computer’s output, and the linear nature of commands lent itself well to the linear nature of spoken word access.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">As graphical user interfaces (GUIs) became more prevalent, people who are blind quickly found themselves less and less able to work with the computer with the same efficiency, speed and capability as their sighted peers (Lazar et al., 2007; Alexander, 1998). While screen-reading and Braille display access technology has continuously been adapted and improved, many such efforts at improving accessibility of GUIs require software developers to follow prescribed standards, often via specialized Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), to allow their software to be used effectively and efficiently by people who are blind. Initiatives such as Microsoft’s Active Accessibility were an early attempt to standardize access to graphical elements by users with disabilities (Lazar et al., 2007). However, no standard to implement such APIs was in place at the time. In fact, implementing accessibility required additional efforts on the part of the software publisher. Due to the time and effort required, these efforts were focused on mainstream application software and not on software development tools. In a CNN interview, Curtis Chong, former president of the National Federation of the Blind’s Science Division, reported his own personal struggles with the advancing GUI technology as a software developer (Alexander, 1998). He specifically stated that his performance decreased as a result of the graphical tool kit requiring you to drag and drop items on the screen.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The primary method of accessing GUIs for computer users who are blind is the screen reader. Screen readers have become extremely prevalent among users who are blind. A survey taken by WebAIM (Web Accessibility in Mind, a non-profit organization) found that 93% of respondents reporting a significant visual impairment were regular users of screen reading technology (WebAIM, 2013).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Screen readers were designed to read and interpret common application interfaces. The GUIB (Textual and Graphical User Interfaces for Blind People) and Mercator projects are early efforts to provide accessibility of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to visually impaired users (Mynatt &amp; Weber, 1994; Edwards, Mynatt, &amp; Stockton, 1994). Research efforts to provide non-visual GUI accessibility have shifted to web-based interfaces as web-application development became more prevalent. (Takagi, Saito, Fukuda, &amp; Asakawa, 2007; Lazar et al., 2007; K. &amp; C., 2014).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Screen readers extend the command set used to interact with the computer by adding commands which are specific to the needs of speech output. Such commands may include announcing the text on which the cursor is currently located, announcing the position of the cursor, and changing the rate or volume of the synthesized speech.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p6">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The use of Braille to enhance accessibility to computers for individuals who are blind has been explored since the 1970s. In 1971, the first Braille embossing device was released. Braille embossers allow a person to produce hard-copy Braille on paper from a computer. In 1982, Telesensory Inc. released the VersaBraille, the first electronic refreshable Braille terminal for computers available in the United States (Van Gerven &amp; Taylor, 2009), based on a patent received in 1975 by the founder of Handy Tech of Germany (Handy Tech, n.d.). Refreshable Braille displays are devices that display the transmitted text in an array of electronic Braille cells. These cells use mechanical actuators, often using piezoelectric technology, to allow them to instantly produce any Braille character, and just as quickly "refresh" themselves to display a different character. This allows the user to access computer information via tactile output, using the Braille written language. Additionally, many contemporary Braille displays can also function as input devices, allowing the user to input information into the computer using the Braille language.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p7">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Also, during the 1980s, Braille "notetaker" devices were introduced, providing the user with the ability to both input text using the Braille code as well as read content using both synthetic speech and refreshable Braille. A popular early device was known as the Braille n’Speak and was developed by Blazie Engineering. Notetakers used preinstalled custom software designed and written specifically for their use case. These devices allowed a Braille user to perform functions similar to a PDA device such as maintaining an address book and calendar and taking notes but did not provide access to mainstream computing interfaces on their own.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p8">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">As screen reader software was developed and improved, the ability to represent content in Braille as well as via speech was developed. Popular screen readers such as Job Access With Speech (JAWS), Non-Visual Desktop Access (NVDA) and Apple’s VoiceOver have Braille output support. The simplest mode of operation is to simply display in Braille the same text which is being spoken aloud. However, because a Braille display is simply a row of independently addressable Braille cells, there exists significant potential to improve accessibility by directly interacting with the Braille cells in novel ways. Screen readers do take advantage of this for some use cases, such as "status cells" which allow a small number of cells to be designated such that they display various codes contextually relevant to the current operation (Freedom Scientific, 2014). For example, a status cell might indicate whether the user is currently focused on a check box, button, or text field.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p9">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Despite many years of innovation and further developments in screen reader technology, a software developer who is blind still faces unique challenges today. Access to information on a computer by a person who is blind is often linear (Edwards, Mynatt, &amp; Stockton, 1994; WebAIM, 2013). Using a screen reader, the individual will access information either audibly, as a stream of spoken words and/or sound effects, or through a Braille display device. Modern integrated development environments (IDEs) typically expose many types of contextually sensitive information at the same time on the screen. These developers may find it challenging, frustrating, or even impossible to keep up with the flood of information while seeking out relevant bits of content and ignoring repetitive, unrelated and unimportant information (Lazar et al., 2007). An exploratory study by Mealin and Murphy-Hill (2012) found that one of the most significant challenges software developers who are blind face is that of information seeking—being able to locate relevant information quickly without needing to navigate away from the current focus. The developers in the study reported that the only way these developers have to alleviate this challenge is to take notes on another device or in another program. This method, however, is not interactive and does not allow the developer to view changes to screen content without again navigating to the content. Efforts have been made to improve the accessibility of complex graphical user interfaces by analyzing users’ abilities. Automatically generated interfaces were developed specifically for users with motor impairments (Wobbrock, Kane, Gajos, Harada, &amp; Froehlich, 2011). We have not seen any such developments aimed at users with blindness or visual impairments.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p10">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">We explored the possibility of a tactile method of assisting developers with locating and keeping up with screen content. Tactile graphics have been used in many educational contexts, including geography and mathematics. They have also been used as an orientation aid (Chen &amp; Takagi, 2014). Most implementations of tactile graphics involve a hard-copy printout onto paper or plastic of an image, with its lines or patterns represented as raised bumps or textures. While a printout of an IDE’s user interface may assist a developer with learning where on the screen important content is displayed, we did not find that this approach would be beneficial, because simply knowing the on-screen location of the content in two-dimensional space will not assist the developer using a screen reader with accessing that information quickly on demand. A printout is also not dynamic and cannot contextually change in real time as refreshable Braille can.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">METHODOLOGY</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">For our initial examination into the potential improvement in the efficiency and user experience of visually impaired users when using Braille as an addition to auditory screen readers, we performed a single-subject longitudinal study. Single-subject longitudinal studies produce statistically significant results in studies that compare alternative treatments (Edgington, 1967; Onghena, 1992). We designed an ABAB test with a single-subject we recruited, after obtaining approval from the IRB at Minnesota State University, Mankato. Our participant is a student who is blind, is a proficient Braille reader and has taken several software development courses. The participant is female, in the range of 18-24 years of age, and was a senior at Minnesota State University, Mankato at the time of testing. She uses Braille in her daily life as a primary means of accessing written information. The participant makes use of a Braille display device on a regular basis as well as a screen reader to access the computer.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The study consisted of asking the participant to perform four different common software development tasks. We performed an exploration of introductory textbooks on software development. Our inquiry revealed a set of tasks which are taught in many languages and development environments. The tasks we selected to be performed by the participant were derived from these common tasks. These are:</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The software selected for testing is used in the course IT 320 at Minnesota State University, Mankato. We used a program emulator package for the MIPS architecture, curiously titled "PC-SPIM” (MIPS backwards). The software provides an accompanying integrated development environment (IDE) for programming the simulation in assembly language. (See Figure 1)</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">When accessed with a traditional screen reader without any additional tools, the entire content and controls of PC-SPIM can be accessed. As is visible in Figure 1, all content is textual, and thus can be presented verbally. However, the design of the user interface has not been optimized in any way to assist those using assistive technology. This results in potential significant difficulty for the student in navigating the application and accessing information being presented by the user interface. Because screen readers and speech synthesizers are generally optimized for reading English text, many aspects of the interface and code are read in a confusing or cumbersome manner. For example, the string “0($29)” seen in the code window above is recited as “0, left parenthesis, twenty-nine dollars, right parenthesis”. Similarly, the hexadecimal addresses are read out character by character, for example “zero x zero zero four zero zero zero zero eight”, and the assembly language mnemonics are read as if they are words; the “addiu” instruction is recited similar to the word “ado”. These are some of the shortcomings we are attempting to address with our solution.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">For the screen reader, Non-Visual Desktop Access (NVDA) was chosen. Its open source nature and use of modern accessibility standards made it an excellent choice for pairing the additional Braille technologies with PC-SPIM.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">For Braille-enhanced tests, we designed a custom software interface, known to NVDA as an “add-on”, which interacts with both the IDE’s user interface and the Braille display by using the Python scripting component of the NVDA screen reader. This software provides access to various components of the IDE in real-time, allowing the software developer to quickly access information without navigating through the IDE’s numerous displays. This technique is related to the “status cells” functionality that is offered by screen readers, but in this case it is specifically designed to address the needs of a software developer using the PC-SPIM software. In addition, the custom software provides quick access to many IDE features directly from the Braille display.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Finally, the cost of assistive technology is often prohibitive; the cost of the Focus 80 Blue product used during the study is $7,795.00 at the time of this writing. The high cost of this equipment can limit its availability; therefore, even though this study has demonstrated significant benefits from using the Braille display, the cost may limit its application in a real-world setting.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">This study serves as a demonstration of the need for more intense and detailed evaluation of the advantages that can be provided to software developers when using Braille and accompanying software to aid in information retrieval.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx5.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The GUI is not going away, but technologies such as Braille displays and the accompanying software modules, which provide customized interfaces for them, can help give individuals who are blind the best chance of remaining competitive in the ever-evolving technology industry.</span></p>
