<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The Yuan T. Lee Foundation Science Education for All (YTLF) has implemented a science camp for students with visual impairments in Central Taiwan since 2009. The implementation of the camp serves as an informal science education practice model that informs curriculum design and development, personnel preparation and organization, as well as perceptions toward students with visual impairments. This article gives an overall introduction to the implementation of the camp in addition to the ideas and the outcomes.</span>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">“Science instruction and activities by nature often rely on visual presentations; therefore, adaptions and accommodations are needed in order to allow students with visual impairments to gain full access to the science classroom” (Wild &amp; Koehler, 2017, p. 449). According to Drs. Henry Wedler and Cary Supalo, who are both scientists with blindness who have dedicated themselves to making science more accessible for students with visual impairments, hands-on learning is crucial in science education for students with visual impairments (Wedler et al., 2012; Supalo, Dwyer, Eberhart, Bunnag, &amp; Mallouk, 2009). Their personal science learning experiences inform the importance of providing tactile materials and assistive technologies when teaching science to students with visual impairments. Students with visual impairments need to use their other senses to make observations and obtain firsthand information. Their abstract thinking ability (Wedler et al., 2014) as well as independence and autonomy in the science classroom (Supalo, Isaacson, &amp; Lombardi, 2014) should be cultivated through science learning.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Research has shown that providing students with out-of-school opportunities can effectively facilitate their active participation and increase their performance in science-related activities in the school (Beltramo, 2017; Riedinger &amp; Taylor, 2016; Dickerson et al., 1995). According to Young, Ero-Tolliver, Young, and Ford (2017), real world and culturally relevant literature and lesson plans can help students relate their out-of-school experiences to the school science curriculum. Thus, students’ cultural background identities should be considered when giving them educational interventions to increase their interests in science (Beltramo, 2017; Young et al., 2017; Bricker &amp; Bell, 2014). So often, students with visual impairments are discouraged from full participation in science-related activities in the school due to multiple reasons including the lack of adequate adaptions and accommodations (Wedler et al., 2014; Supalo, Wohlers, &amp; Humphrey, 2011; Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008). Informal science learning opportunities, such as science camps, can serve the needs of students with visual impairments and allow them to gain more science learning experiences.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Inquiry-based instruction has been proved to be beneficial for students with visual impairments in learning science (Koehler, 2017; Hilson, Hobson, &amp; Wild, 2016; Wild, Farrand, &amp; Hilson, 2013; Wild, Hilson, &amp; Hobson, 2013; Wild &amp; Trundle, 2010a, 2010b). The informal science experience that will be described in this paper not only provided students with an out-of-school opportunity, but the activities built upon the need for students to learn by doing through inquiry-based instruction. The definition of inquiry-based instruction is:
</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p4">
<blockquote class="ltx_quote">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Through discussion and reflection, students can come to realize that scientific inquiry embodies a set of values. These values include respect for the importance of logical thinking, precision, open-mindedness, objectivity, skepticism, and a requirement for transparent research procedures and honest reporting of findings. (National Research Council, 2012, p. 248)</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Accordingly, students with visual impairments should be provided with this type of inquiry-based science curriculums and lesson plans that are designed to meet their needs so as to support their learning in science.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p6">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Several science camps in the United States have been held to serve students with visual impairments. For instance, the National Federation of the Blind’s (NFB) National Center for Blind Youth in Science (NCBYS) collaborated with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and held the SEE Project Yerkes Astronomy Camp to improve Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics(STEM) education for the blind and encourage students with blindness to pursue STEM careers (2017). They developed and implemented tactile space science books and curriculum materials, science academies for middle and high school students with blindness, and college-level internship and mentoring programs in the camp (Beck-Winchatz &amp; Riccobono, 2008). The NCBYS also organized other science camps, such as the NFB Youth Slam and the NFB Engineering Quotient program (NFB EQ) (2019). The NFB Youth Slam provides STEM hands-on learning opportunities for high school students with blindness, and the NFB EQ is an engineering program for high school students with visual impairments. The Lighthouse for the Visually Impaired and Blind hosted the California Chemistry Camp for high school students with visual impairments that provided chemistry experiments employing the sense of smell and computational chemistry experiments (Wedler et al., 2014).</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">STUDENTS WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS IN TAIWAN</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">According to Special Education Transmit Net (2018), the total number of students with visual impairments at elementary, junior high, and senior high school levels in Taiwan is 902; of those students, 775 attend regular schools. Given the statistical data, 86% of students with visual impairments in Taiwan are placed in general education settings and 14% of them attend special education schools. Unfortunately, science education for students with visual impairments is undervalued in Taiwan. Students with visual impairments do not receive equal science learning opportunities as compared to their sighted peers. There is a lack of collaboration between science education teachers and teachers of students with visual impairments as well as a lack of adaptive science learning materials or experimental equipment provided to students with visual impairments in the schools (Chiu, 2015; Tseng &amp; Liao, 2011).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">YTLF is a nonprofit organization that aims at promoting science for all, especially for elementary school-aged children. The foundation was established in 1994 with a main office located in Northern Taiwan. In 2001 and 2002, two branches were established in Southern and Central Taiwan to provide better service to additional local areas. In the spring of 2009, a request from a group of parents of children with visual impairments was received by the Central Taiwan branch office. These parents stated that their children did not receive the science education they deserved in the school. In the spirit of promoting science to all, the director of the Central Taiwan Branch organized and implemented the very first science camp for students in Taiwan who are blind or visually impaired that summer.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The Central Taiwan branch office is located at National Changhua University of Education (NCUE) in Changhua City. To provide adequate services for students with visual impairments, this Changhua Branch of YTLF sought collaboration with academic units within the university, including Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics, Graduate Institute of Science Education, and Department of Special Education. The Changhua Branch also worked closely with Changhua Welfare Foundation for the Blind and Visually Impaired, which is an organization established by parents of children with visual impairments in Changhua County, for professional services and educational resources in visual impairments.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">YTLF believes in </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">learning by doing</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">. Thus, all camp activities are hands-on based. The camp activities for students with visual impairments were originally designed for sighted students by camp instructors who are university professors specialized in science or mathematics and K-12 science or mathematics teachers. In order to bring more firsthand observation and information to students with visual impairments, a multisensory teaching approach is adopted and emphasized. Adaptions and accommodations such as using assistive technologies, providing braille and large print, and giving more time and verbal description are made to make the camp activities more accessible to students with visual impairments.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCIENCE CAMP</h2>
<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx3.SSx1">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Overview</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The science camp for students with visual impairments is held on NCUE campus during the summer and winter breaks in Taiwan mostly in July and February. This five-day science camp program consists of one orientation and mobility (O&amp;M) class, sixteen hands-on activities in mathematics, chemistry, physics, or biology, and two physical education (PE) classes (See Figure 1). All student participants must attend the O&amp;M class led by certified O&amp;M specialists on the first day of the camp in order to continue participating in the other activities. The two PE classes are embedded in the camp program with the consideration of students’ wellness over the camp week. Instructors are recruited from universities and local school districts. Hence, there are university professors as well as school teachers specialized in science, mathematics, or special education designing activities based upon the needs of students with visual impairments.</span></p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Curriculum</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The four focused curriculum areas that are provided in the camp program include mathematics, chemistry, physics, and biology. For each area, three examples are provided and described in the following:</span></p>
</div>
<section class="ltx_subsubsection" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx1">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection" style="font-size:120%;">Mathematics</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 1: To understand the structure of a regular dodecahedron, students are provided with colored paper to make some basic origami geometric shapes, especially pentagons. Each student is then given a learning product designed by the instructor to build up a regular dodecahedron while following the instructor’s verbal guidance and the TA’s assistance if needed (See Figure 2a). The instructor talks about the application of dodecahedra in history.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 2: To learn about currency conversion, students are given bills and coins of different countries and use their fingers to feel the textures and sizes of those bills and coins. Students share their experiences about using different currencies while traveling overseas. The instructor describes what is on those bills and coins and tells history of trade between countries that leads to the significance of currency conversion. Students then begin to do some currency conversion mathematics problems given by the instructor.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 3: To solve a historically notable mathematics problem—the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, each student is provided with a handmade tactile map that helps give them an idea on how those seven bridges connect to each other. Students who are blind use their fingers on the map to think and test if they can find a route that allows them to walk through all the seven bridges just one time. Students who are visually impaired usually use both their residual vision and fingers to manage this task.</span></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ltx_subsubsection" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx2">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection" style="font-size:120%;">Chemistry</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 1: To learn about kitchen ingredients, students are provided with salt, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, oil, pepper, flour, baking soda, dish soap, etc. Students use their fingers to feel the textures, smell them, and even taste some of them. They predict what would happen after stirring each ingredient in a cup of water. Students are encouraged to use multiple senses to make observations and share what they observed with the whole class.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 2: To learn that chemical reactions would produce gas, each student is first given a Vitamin C tablet and asked to listen closely to the cup after dropping the tablet in the water. Each student is then given some marble pieces and a titration flask that contains a hydrochloric acid solution. Students drop marble pieces in the flask carefully and seal the opening of the flask with a balloon. Their hands can feel the balloon gradually becomes bigger and bigger. Lastly, students do the Coke and Mentos experiment to experience the intense phenomenon.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 3: To learn about series and parallel circuits, students first make fruit batteries and test if those fruit batteries make a calculator or an alarm clock work (See Figure 1: Chemistry). Each student is then provided with a tiny buzzer and connects it to the circuit. Students test and determine what fruit makes the best fruit battery by the loudness of the sounds made by the buzzer. They also think what they can do, especially how to rearrange circuits, to make more electricity.
</span></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ltx_subsubsection" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx3">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection" style="font-size:120%;">Physics</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 1: To learn about balance and the center of mass, students are given a series of activities: 1) Following the instructor’s verbal guidance, students position their bodies in different ways and try to make their bodies still in those positions. For instance, they are asked to stand still on one foot; 2) Student are asked to adjust the position of a string tied loosely to a wooden baseball bat and try to hold the other end of the string and make the bat balanced in the air; 3) Students are provided with popsicle sticks and asked to use their finger tips or joints to make one or multiple popsicle sticks sit still on their finger tips or joints; 4) Students are provided with papers in different shapes and asked to place each paper on the tip of a toothpick fixed in a chunk of clay on the table and make the paper sit on the tip.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 2: To learn about the effect of friction on different surfaces, each student first makes a cardboard elephant and ties one end of a string to the cardboard elephant and the other end to a roll of tape. There are three stations in the classroom and each station has a table with a plastic sheet, print paper, or sand paper taped on the surface of the table. Students go to each station and put the cardboard elephant on the adapted surface and then drop the roll of tape toward the floor. They use tactile rulers to measure the distance that the elephant moves forward.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 3: To understand that structure matters, the instructor gives several examples of bridges by providing students with basic bridge structure samples and verbal descriptions. The instructor then teaches students how to roll the paper to make paper sticks. Students are encouraged to think and make a sustainable paper bridge with the paper sticks they make in small groups. Lastly, all groups compete to determine which bridge can support the most books.</span></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ltx_subsubsection" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx4">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection" style="font-size:120%;">Biology</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 1: To learn about birds, the instructor brings two white birds that chirp often to the classroom in order to provide students with the opportunity to observe birds closely. The instructor provides different kinds of specimens of birds for students to examine their sizes and traits and plays bird chirping sounds for them to hear.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx4.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 2: To learn about reptiles, the instructor brings turtles, snakes, lizards, frogs, etc. to the classroom for the students to touch, feel, and examine their traits. Figure 2a shows a student who is blind feels a snake in the class.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx4.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Example 3: To learn about the evolution of plants from leaves to fruits, the instructor first provides different kinds of leaves and fruits for students to examine their shapes and traits tactilely and/or visually and talks about the evolution of plants. The instructor then provides each student with a pea pod with green peas inside and a pea leaf and describes how a pea pod evolves from a pea leaf. On the top right corner of Figure 1 is a student who is visually impaired being shown using a lighted handheld magnifier to examine a pea pod in the class. Lastly, each student is given a bag of adaptive tactile materials, including a piece of leaf-shaped cloth, short strings, and beads to make a pea pod.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx4.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">It is noted that the curriculum focused activities provided at the camp can be categorized into three types: guided assembling, sensory experiences, and challenging tasks (See Figure 2). These three types of activities are explained by using examples in the following:</span></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ltx_subsubsection" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx5">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection" style="font-size:120%;">Guided Assembling</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">To make students feel a sense of accomplishment, some activities emphasize </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">learning by making</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">. Therefore, students can take their own pieces of work home to share their accomplishments with their families. In Figure 2a, a student is being guided by a teaching assistant (TA) to assemble a dodecahedron that she will be happy to take home. Moreover, students are always encouraged to utilize multiple senses to make observations.</span></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ltx_subsubsection" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx6">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection" style="font-size:120%;">Sensory Experiences</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx6.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In Figure 2b, a third grader feels a snake for the very first time in a biology class introducing reptile animals. He tells the instructor that he did not know that a snake could feel so cool in temperature and could twist its own body around his wrist in that way.</span></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ltx_subsubsection" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx7">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection" style="font-size:120%;">Challenging Tasks</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.SSSx7.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In addition to the belief of </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">learning by playing</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">, challenging tasks always excite our students at the camp. In Figure 2c, students are divided into two groups and are asked to design a paper boat that can carry as many washers as possible. After sealing the paper boat with plastic wrap, students compete to determine which boat can support the most washers. This type of activity helps stimulate students’ imagination which is an important ability in learning science, because not everything is observable or approachable by human senses.</span></p>

<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx3.SSx3">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Teaching Assistants (TAs)</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">To provide adequate assistance to students with visual impairments at the science camp, knowledge of and skills in special education, science, and mathematics are all necessary. In this regard, TAs are recruited from the Department of Special Education as well as the College of Science, including the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics at NCUE. These TAs are either undergraduate or graduate students. Many of them are pre-service teachers who are eager to gain more experience in assisting or working with students with special needs.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">It is believed that the combination of these TAs’ diverse backgrounds can bring the most benefit to the implementation of the camp. For instance, when making adaptive learning materials, those whose background in science or mathematics can share their understanding of the activity content while those whose background in special education can share their knowledge of learning material adaptation. Their collaboration makes the preparation work more efficient. Although the main purpose of the camp is to provide service to students with visual impairments, the camp offers opportunities for NCUE’s undergraduate and graduate students to learn and to grow from assisting students with visual impairments in learning science.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">To prepare TAs with the ability to assist students with visual impairments at the camp, all TAs are required to participate in the two-day TA training program which takes place prior to the camp. The objectives of the training include: 1) to gain the knowledge of visual impairments (Figure 3a); 2) to learn O&amp;M techniques to guide students with visual impairments (Figure 3b); and 3) to understand all activity contents to prepare adaptive learning materials (Figure 3c).</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Each classroom where students are assigned is specifically prepared for each individual student at the camp. Upon registration, students are guided to different classrooms based on their school grade levels, including first to fourth grades, fifth and sixth grades, junior high school level, and senior high school level. According to our years of experience, students with blindness usually need more assistance than students with low vision. Therefore, we consider students’ vision conditions, learning abilities, as well as the absence or presence of additional disabilities to group them. Taking Figure 4 as an example, the group has one student with low vision (top right corner) and two students with blindness. The student with blindness who needs more assistance is arranged to sit next to the TA.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx4.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In most recent times, there are sixty to seventy students with visual impairments from all over the country attending the camp each time. To best assist these students, twenty to thirty TAs are needed. Generally, there are twenty students in a classroom with the assistance of eight TAs, which gives a student-TA ratio of 2.5. From our previous experience, a TA can assist a maximum of four students with visual impairments at a time. However, this rarely happens. Assisting two to three students at a time is more manageable.</span></p>

Sixteen students with visual impairments are expected in a classroom and divided into four groups based on the heterogenous grouping considerations noted above. In rare cases, a TA can assist four students with visual impairments. If there is a student who needs additional assistance, one-on-one assistance will be provided. As a result, a TA could assist four or three students at a time or provide one-on-one assistance to a student with additional needs in this classroom.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Upon the end of the camp, the Changhua Branch would ask students to reflect on their camp experiences and give their feedback in order to make improvements in future camps. Given enough time prior to the camp closing ceremony, each student is able to finish writing a letter to the Changhua Branch on the last day of the camp. TAs would then collect the letters and deliver them to the Changhua Branch. Likewise, after the camp week, TAs would be asked by the Changhua Branch to share their ideas, thoughts, or feelings about the camp in a written format within two weeks.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The significance of the camp emerged from those letters. Thus, the researcher started a research project that aimed to learn more about the impact of the camp on the students and the TAs. The collected data included videotapes and fieldnotes from classroom observations and student interviews as well as written responses from a TA survey. The researcher managed to travel across the country to interview 16 students who had participated in the camp. There were 5 middle school students and 11 high school students among the 16. Verbal consent from the students and their parents to participate in the research was obtained on the phone while scheduling the interview and videotaped on the interview day. The researcher also gathered all the survey responses from the 28 TAs who served at the camp in the summer of 2014. Written consent from the TAs was obtained on the TA recruitment form prior to the camp.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Because this paper is a project report that aims at introducing the camp, only necessary information regarding the methodology is addressed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to ask the students about their science learning experiences and how they learned science. The TAs were asked to give written responses to a series of open-ended questions about their TA experiences and what they had learned from participating in the camp. Student voice and performance as well as TA voice were considered to speak about the impact of the camp. Thus, responses from the students and TAs were presented in the following to show the outcomes of the camp.</span></p>
