<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">Pre-conference workshop</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The conference opened with a six-hour Space Camp “experience” on Friday, October 4 that was held at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Participants had the opportunity to experience how some space camp activities have been adapted for students with visual impairments. This was done by providing large print and/or braille scripts on different space missions that students undertake as part of their experience. Additionally, braille labels were placed on control panels on Space Shuttle simulators. Text-to-speech control panels were used to provide audio feedback to control values that informed the student participant about what to do next. All participants had the opportunity to use the multi-access trainer (MAT) to experience a 360-degree rotation on three axes that all astronauts experience. There was also a 1/6-gravity walking experience that simulated what astronauts experienced in terms of gravity when walking on the moon during the Apollo moon missions. Overall, this experiential learning opportunity was successfully adapted for students with visual impairments.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">ISLAND keynote</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">On the evening of October 4th, ISLAND conference attendees had the opportunity to listen to a keynote lecture by Dave Schleppenbach of Tactile Solutions, Inc. from Lafayette, Indiana. Mr. Schleppenbach talked about his interests in hard copy braille production and his long-term vision of developing refreshable braille devices. This presentation featured his company’s prototype multi-line refreshable braille display. This device is magnetically driven and can provide both refreshable braille and tactile graphics representations on the same device. This type of capability has long been desired by the blind community; however, previously this protype technology has not been possible due to engineering challenges. This device has a less than one second refresh rate which is much faster than any prototypes featured in the past. This innovative device has high potential to revolutionize how persons who are blind and read braille can read and access braille content in the future.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The first presentation at this year’s conference on the Saturday program was delivered by Kevin L. Kelly, Ph. D., from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Technical Service Center. Dr. Kelly discussed the wide variety of internship programs the Department of Reclamation currently promotes for persons with disabilities. These internship programs provide opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in STEM fields of study. Persons from other minority groups are also welcome to participate in this inclusive internship program. The Department of Reclamation has one of the largest employment records for hiring persons with disabilities. At the time of the presentation, approximately 12% of all employees have a documented disability. Recruitment efforts are not targeting one specific disability group as this is prohibited by the United States Federal government. Therefore, recruitment efforts are made through non-for-profit organizations. Many times, internship opportunities can lead to full-time employment opportunities for participants in these internship programs. Over all, this program promotes persons with disabilities in the STEM fields of study by providing employment opportunities and work experiences for persons with disabilities interested in STEM fields of study.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">In Search of a Molecular Vision</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Touching on a similar theme, the presentation of Dan Barrett from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Evanston, Illinois, discussed the W3C’s new chemistry community group that was started in Summer 2019. This W3C group is open to all interested persons who wish to have a voice in how chemistry content can be made more accessible in a digital context. This presentation illustrated a series of known general chemistry examples that have traditionally presented accessibility challenges. In the current landscape, these examples have leveraged tactile graphics, braille and large print, along with three-dimensional model representations to address the accessibility gap. Dan discussed how these current best practices may be translated and transformed on a digital platform. This presentation spoke about the current landscape and future directions as to where we need to go. The W3C chemistry group is working on defining the knowledge gap clearly so that viable solutions can be proposed to help us get to where we want to be.</span></p>

This presentation discussed the adaptations Dr. San Miguel was forced to make as he went through his schooling experience. He depended on lip reading as his main form of communication throughout his professional career. He had a reluctance to learn sign language because it would make him appear more different than his classmates since he was mainstreamed in his entire K12 experience. However, this communication methodology did not hold him back since he had a successful career for both NASA and the Coca Cola Company. Overall, his life experience shows the resilience a person with a disability needs to have in order to successfully overcome their disability in a STEM field.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx18.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The 2019 ISLAND conference included several presentations that featured techniques and approaches for teaching a range of scientific disciplines in unique ways. Many presenters described and demonstrated methodologies that were implemented in their specific situations, which could be replicated and adapted for different contexts. Additionally, several presentations featured authentic perspectives by scientists with different disabilities. This snapshot view of challenges that were presented by persons with disabilities added a complementary flavor to this year’s proceedings. More formal research conducted in the future, to determine the effectiveness of some of the methodologies presented as part of the ISLAND conference, may lead to innovative new best practices for the science education community. Multisensory science instruction is becoming more mainstream, and new innovative digital technologies are becoming more readily available to effectively render STEM content in more inclusive, accessible ways. These advances will further promote persons with disabilities entering the STEM fields of study.
