<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">All students deserve to be engaged in high-quality science instruction that moves beyond memorization and recall of facts and offers opportunities for sensemaking. Science achievement is alarmingly low signifying there is a large percentage of students experiencing difficulty in science. The low science achievement may be symptomatic of gaps in opportunities for sensemaking within the science classroom. Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, the current study explored the relationship between middle school science teacher beliefs and opportunities students experiencing difficulty in science had to participate in sensemaking discussions. Integrated findings from the study suggest that teachers’ beliefs influenced the opportunities students experiencing difficulty had to participate in sensemaking discussions and, at times, there was a mismatch between teacher beliefs and practice. The current study addresses an important gap in the research literature on opportunities students experiencing difficulty have for sensemaking in science classrooms, a grossly under researched area of inquiry.<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright"></span></span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Despite the push for improvement in science achievement for all students by researchers and policy makers (e.g., National Research Council, 2013; U.S. Department of Education, 2019), there is still notably low achievement in the content area of science, especially when compared to other content areas such as mathematics and reading (NGSS Lead States, 2013; U.S. Department of Education, 2019). On the 2019 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Science Assessment, 65% of student  performed basic or below basic (not proficient) on the NAEP Science Assessment. The achievement gap between students proficient in science and students not proficient in science is troubling.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Findings from research suggest the gaps in achievement are largely a result of the inequitable learning opportunities students receive within science (Moss et al., 2008; National Research Council, 2012; Oakes et al., 1990). For example, some students receive more opportunities to participate in whole-class discussions than others. Opportunities to participate in learning through whole-class discussion is critical as Vygotsky (1978) suggests that communication is a pre-requisite to learning and understanding concepts. Furthermore, when science learning includes mediation through instruction that includes discussion, students experiencing difficulty not only benefit but can approach the level of learning of their peers who are not experiencing difficulty (Mastropieri et al., 1998; Scruggs et al., 1993). Oakes and colleagues (1990) go on further to say, “unequal learning opportunities provide some specific clues to how educational practices may help create and perpetuate differences in achievement and participation” (p. 6). Pak and Parsons (2020) take it a step further to describe what is happening in terms of the gap as an equity gap and stress that the current educational system underserves students who may be experiencing difficulty.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">National organizations such as the National Science Teaching Association (NSTA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) promote equitable instructional opportunities for all students (Anderson et al., 1998). National science standards like the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) were developed for </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">all</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> students to have equitable access to more rigorous science instruction (NGSS Lead States, 2013). Additionally, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; Every Student Succeeds Act, 2015) requires that all students be taught to high academic standards and states a commitment to equal opportunity for all students. National organizations, national standards, and current law are all promoting, and in some cases requiring, equitable opportunities to learn for all students but there is currently little research suggesting to what extent these opportunities are or are not occurring within the science classroom for students experiencing difficulty in science. The term “students experiencing difficulty” is used rather than “students who struggle” to signify that their difficulty or struggle is not fixed, does not define them as a student, but is simply an experience they are having that has the potential to change. Therefore, it is critical to look beyond simply </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">if</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> opportunities to learn are provided and to look more deeply at what types of opportunities are made available and who is or is not receiving these opportunities (Miller et al., 2018). Pak and Parsons (2020) argue that to study instructional practices gaps in equity must be explicitly examined. Additionally, they argue that systemic and individual biases toward students experiencing difficulty need to be addressed to move toward transformational practices within more rigorous curricula. The priority then, and the purpose of this study, is to examine equity issues, namely sensemaking opportunities within whole-class discussions, during science instruction for students experiencing difficulty in science.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE</h2>
<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx2.SSx1">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Sensemaking</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.SSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Odden and Russ (2019) define sensemaking as “a dynamic process of building or revising an explanation in order to “figure something out”—to ascertain the mechanism underlying a phenomenon in order to resolve a gap or inconsistency in one’s understanding” (p. 192). Going public with ideas, modeling, and reasoning from evidence are all a large part of the NGSS and critical to sensemaking (NGSS Lead States, 2013). Having regular and meaningful opportunities to engage in sensemaking practices is critical to fostering equitable participation in science and teachers play a critical role in who gets opportunities and what those opportunities look like (Kloser et al., 2019).</span></p>
</div>
<section class="ltx_subsubsection" id="Sx2.SSx1.SSSx1">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection" style="font-size:120%;">Teachers’ Role in Sensemaking Opportunities</h4>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.SSx1.SSSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">When teachers are at the center of facilitating student talk, they are at the center of facilitating sensemaking. In their review of student sensemaking across disciplines, Fitzgerald and Palincsar (2019), found several teaching practices that promote sensemaking. Overarching all the practices was engagement in discourse. Within discourse, they highlighted several teaching practices associated with sensemaking including, questioning, making connections, increasing challenge, enculturating students to engage in sensemaking, and differentiating instruction, all of which fall within the role of the teacher. Drew and Thomas (2021) suggest engaging students in discussion where all students are expected to listen and speak. They go on further to say that discussion is an area that students experiencing difficulty may struggle so teachers need to ensure students are explicitly taught how to participate in discussions. Furthermore, in science classrooms, teachers hold the power to engage students in the discourse taking place (Kelly, 2007) and a teachers’ interactions with students have the power to influence student engagement in sensemaking (Mercer et al., 2009; Resnick et al., 2010). However, a teachers’ interaction with students is influenced by their beliefs (Kiely et al., 2015).</span></p>

<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx2.SSx2">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Teachers’ Beliefs</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.SSx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Teachers’ beliefs are just a small part of a more complex system (Churchland &amp; Churchland, 2013; Fives &amp; Buehl, 2012). Research suggests that overall, teachers’ beliefs influence their practice including what they do in the classroom, who they interact with, and how they interact with students (Cain &amp; Cain, 2012; Khader, 2012; Klehm, 2014; Phipps &amp; Borg, 2009).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.SSx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Empirical evidence suggests that teachers’ beliefs may impact the instructional interactions that take place, and the level of dialogue teachers use with students (Jordan et al., 1993; Jordan &amp; Stanovich, 2003; Kahn &amp; Lewis, 2014; Stanovich &amp; Jordan, 1998). To echo this, Klehm (2014) found that teachers’ beliefs about students’ ability to learn and ability to achieve higher level thinking, such as the thinking required by the NGSS, predicted scores on achievement tests. Said another way, teachers’ beliefs have an impact on their teaching practices and therefore, the achievement of their students. Assessing teachers’ beliefs can show whether teachers are more likely to engage students experiencing difficulty in more cognitively demanding instruction (Kiely et al., 2015) such as the instruction required by the NGSS. Research suggests that students experiencing difficulty are often given less access to demanding science instruction (Weiss et al., 2003) and teachers hold low expectations for their learning and performance (Cook et al. 2000; Moss et al., 2008; Pettit, 2011) which can impact their outcomes (Jussim &amp; Harber, 2005). Whether or not a student experiencing difficulty gets the support they need in the classroom has connections to a teacher’s beliefs (Kiely et al., 2015).</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">RATIONALE</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The NGSS state that all students are capable of sensemaking in science and stress the criticality of providing students with equitable opportunities to engage in sensemaking in science classrooms (Lee et al., 2014). Research suggests the teacher plays a critical role in who gets opportunities for sensemaking and what those opportunities look like in science classrooms. However, there is little research looking specifically at students experiencing difficulty in the science classroom. We cannot say </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">science for all</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> if we do not know if </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">all</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> includes students experiencing difficulty. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore equity issues, namely sensemaking opportunities during whole-class discussions, for this group of students.

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">After classroom observations (described below), teachers were asked to sort their students (</span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">n</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> = 52) into one of two student groups: 1) students experiencing difficulty in science and 2) students NOT experiencing difficulty in science. Twenty-five percent (</span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">n</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> = 13) of the student participants were identified as students experiencing difficulty in science. This included both students with and without Individual Education Programs (IEPs). Given that a focus of the study was on teacher beliefs (i.e., who experiences difficulty and how that influences their interactions in the classroom) and would be elaborated on as a part of the data collection, the teachers were not provided with a definition of who a student is that experiences difficulty in science. The decision was made by teachers based on formative assessments, summative assessments, or observations made during science instruction throughout that school year. It was important that teachers were the ones identifying students experiencing difficulty in science as they were the ones who spent the most time interacting with this group of students. According to Reinholz and Shah (2018) it is logical to have teachers identify the students experiencing difficulty because the ways teachers identify students are what drives the interactions they have with students and ultimately the opportunities they have during instruction. Teacher participants were asked to give a rationale for why they identified a student as experiencing difficulty in science and gave the following reasons: trouble focusing, executive functioning issues, low work ethic, low self-esteem, poor reading and writing skills, low attendance, task completion issues, challenges with working independently, struggling with science concepts, and suspected undiagnosed dyslexia.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Audio from each observation was transcribed and then checked for accuracy by the principal investigator. After all transcriptions were accurate, a total of 26 whole-class discussions were identified. Whole-class discussions were identified as instructional time where the whole-class was involved in a discussion. Students and the teacher needed to be actively discussing science content, phenomena, or a lab. Whole-class discussions did not include independent work or small group work.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx4.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Within each whole-class discussion, a total of 428 participation sequences were identified. For this study, participation sequences served as the unit of analysis. A participation sequence is any string of utterances from a single student. Meaning, if a new student contributes, a new string of utterances or participation sequence begins. If a student speaks back and forth with the teacher and no other student contributes, then this is all considered part of one string of utterances or participation sequence. Several instances were not counted as a participation sequence including non-consenting or unidentifiable students speaking, multiple students answering or choral responses, and side conversations or turn and talks. Only whole-class discussion with </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">visible participation</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> was included as a participation sequence. The purpose for these decisions was it allowed for the data to be disaggregated by student group, it showed multiple back-and-forth moves which reflect discussion moves teachers use in classroom instruction, and segmenting when a new student speaks made it easier to identify new participation sequences. Further, focusing only on whole-class discussions that were visible allowed student participation to be seen by other students which contributes to positioning students as sensemakers within the discussion.

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx4.SSSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Participation sequences were organized onto a spreadsheet which included the participation sequence number, speaker name, the transcript of what was said, and a column for each code. Audio recordings were also available to coders if needed for review. The participation sequences were coded among three dimensions related to teacher behavior that are well documented in science education literature: solicitation method (Engle, 2012; Sadker et al., 2009; Tanner, 2013), solicitation level (Boyd &amp; Rubin, 2002; Braaten &amp; Windschitl, 2011; Henningsen &amp; Stein, 1997), and teacher evaluation (Engle, 2012; Schoenfeld, 1988). The term solicitation was used instead of questioning in the case that a teacher used a statement, rather than a question, to elicit more information from a student (“explain why you think that” or “tell me more about that”).</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">Solicitation method</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> referred to who—whether the teacher or student—initiates a new participation sequence. Solicitation method was coded as either </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">teacher-initiated</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> or </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">student-initiated</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">. Teacher-initiated meant the teacher was responsible for picking who gets to talk either by calling the student’s name or by pointing to them or using a gesture to let them know it was their turn to participate. Student-initiated meant the student initiated the contribution and started speaking unsolicited without their name being called or receiving a gesture from the teacher to signal it was their turn to participate. </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">Solicitation level</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> referred to the level of cognitive demand (low or high) of the solicitation the student was given to engage. Solicitation level was coded as either </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">low</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> or </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">high</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">. A low-level solicitation was a lower cognitive demand solicitation that typically focused on memorization to recall facts, listing things or describing vocabulary, or procedural tasks that follow specific steps or a formula. These low-level solicitations generally have a “right answer” that can be given in just a few words and do not reveal much about a students’ thinking. A high-level solicitation asked students to share what was happening and explain their thinking. With high-level solicitations students were pushed to do something with their thinking or ideas. There is typically no “right answer.” </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">Teacher evaluation</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> referred to if the teacher evaluated the student’s ideas. Teacher evaluation was coded as </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">yes or no</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">. A code of yes meant the teacher simply stated yes/no or right/wrong without any further inquiry into the idea or the teacher praised the response. A code of no meant the teacher left the correctness of the student’s idea open allowing for other students to evaluate the idea or restates or reformulates the student’s idea so other students have an opportunity to hear or understand the idea. Or, the teacher made the student’s idea public without explicitly evaluating the idea. See Table 2 for an example from the data of each type of code.</span></p>

The two coders had 84% intercoder agreement. Agreement was defined as assigning the same code to a segment. Next, any segment that had disagreements were discussed to ensure the way the segments were coded made sense considering the data and a final code was agreed upon for all segments with disagreements. Finally, emergent themes were identified from the codes. v</span></p>

They noted several benefits. First, teachers noted that giving students opportunities to share their thinking by talking about science supports students who may struggle with sharing their thinking through writing about science. Specifically, teachers described that their students experiencing difficulty struggle to write about what they are making sense of in science, but they are easily able to talk about it and that writing often becomes a barrier for sharing their ideas and thoughts. One teacher said, “It’s so important to encourage them [students experiencing difficulty] to talk because…kids that are struggling, more than anybody, they are more afraid to be a part of the discussion and put themselves out there….”</span></p>

One teacher said, “And I think that with discussions and with talking it just helps them kind of like process the information, a little bit better.” Teachers are also seeing the benefits of the collaborative process of discussion.

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Using data collected from classroom observations of whole-class science discussions and interviews with teacher participants, the current study explored equity issues in sensemaking opportunities between students with and without difficulties and the relationship between teacher beliefs and sensemaking opportunities for students experiencing difficulty. This is a little explored area in the literature so there is much to learn about how middle school science teachers provide opportunities for students experiencing difficulty in whole-class discussions, which are a large part of giving students opportunities for sensemaking in science. This is a particularly critical area for exploration in classrooms where the teacher must rely on their own belief system to guide their interactions during the whole-group discussions. Teacher beliefs have an impact on their instructional interactions with students. Thus, the current study used an explanatory sequential mixed methods design to integrate the quantitative and qualitative results to examine the relationship between teacher beliefs about students experiencing difficulty and their opportunities to participate in sensemaking discussions.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Two main conclusions can be drawn from the integrated findings in this study. First, teachers’ belief in the value of talk for students experiencing difficulty influenced their interactions with this group of students during sensemaking discussions and second, teachers’ beliefs do not always match what is occurring during instruction.</span></p>
</div>
<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx7.SSx1">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Value of Using Talk for Students Experiencing Difficulty in Science</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Because teachers in the study believed that talk was beneficial for students experiencing difficulty, and they also believed that this group of students lack confidence to initiate participation on their own, they tended to solicit participation from them more than expected. This finding is surprising because current literature suggests that students from marginalized groups such as Indigenous students (Bang &amp; Medin, 2010), students from non-dominant communities (Bang et al., 2012), and culturally and linguistically diverse students (Parsons &amp; Carlone, 2013), are not perceived as capable of doing science and their participation is ignored or not solicited at all. Kahn &amp; Lewis (2014) also reported this to be true when specifically examining science teachers’ attitudes toward students experiencing difficulty as a barrier to their success. This idea is also echoed by other scholars who found that when teachers engage students in more authentic forms of discussion that align with the expectations of the NGSS and promote sensemaking, they tend to solicit participation from “privileged or high-track students” (Applebee et al., 2003). What the current study does, however, is demonstrate that contrary to current literature on different marginalized groups, that because of teacher beliefs, students experiencing difficulty </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">are</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> being solicited to participate in sensemaking discussions.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Having opportunities to participate in sensemaking discussions has important implications for students experiencing difficulty. First, current literature suggests that sensemaking supports student learning (Cannady et al., 2019; Resnick et al., 2010) and even if students experiencing difficulty may struggle engaging in discourse, providing them the opportunity can support more equitable participation (Lee et al., 2014). Furthermore, this finding is consistent with current literature that suggests that giving students opportunities to participate in discussions where they can share ideas supports their sensemaking (Wright &amp; Gotwals, 2017).

<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx7.SSx2">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Mismatch Between Beliefs and Practice</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The second main conclusion that can be drawn from this study connects to the ways in which teachers engage with students experiencing difficulty during sensemaking discussions. Namely, their beliefs do not always necessarily match what is occurring during instruction. This finding is not surprising. Numerous studies have found discrepancies between teacher beliefs and practices (Bryan, 2012; Buehl &amp; Beck, 2015). What is interesting in this study, however, is what these discrepancies looked like in relation to sensemaking discussions and how it impacted students experiencing difficulty.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">First, in terms of the level of solicitation given to engage, students experiencing difficulty were given less low-level solicitations, and more high-level solicitations than would be expected, but teachers expressed beliefs that students experiencing difficulty needed more low-level solicitations to feel confident to participate in sensemaking discussions. However, in the current study, the disconnect or mismatch worked for the benefit of the students experiencing difficulty because, in practice, they received less low-level and more high-level solicitations across the units. Reinholz and Shah (2018) suggest that for some student groups, such as students experiencing difficulty, “ensuring fairness in opportunities to learn for students from marginalized groups might actually require allocating them more resources and different resources than students from dominant groups” (p. 146). They go on to state that in some cases inequities, such as what the solicitation level results in the current study suggest, can actually be equitable. The impact of being able to engage in more high-level solicitations than expected is engagement in deeper sensemaking.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Even though the teachers used less low-level solicitations in practice, the beliefs teachers hold regarding the use of low-level solicitations with students experiencing difficulty is troubling because the literature suggests that using high-level solicitations can help students focus on sensemaking (Windschitl et al., 2018) and support the development of complex understandings (Lowell et al., 2022). Teachers holding beliefs about the importance of engaging students experiencing difficulty in low-level solicitations is consistent with current literature that suggests teachers hold low expectations for students experiencing difficulties learning and performance (Moss et al., 2008; Cook et al., 2000; Pettit, 2011).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">While using low-level solicitations can be a good starting point for sensemaking, teachers need to work to push students experiencing difficulties’ thinking further during discussions by continuing to push students to </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">do</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> something with their ideas. This idea was echoed by Lowell et al. (2022) who suggest that overly relying on a single type of talk pattern is not sufficient to support student sensemaking. Furthermore, when teachers provide scaffolding that pushes students to extend their contribution during a discussion, rather than just the simple Initiation-Response-Evaluation sequence (Mehan, 1979) commonly seen in science classrooms (Nassaji &amp; Wells, 2000; Pimentel &amp; McNeill, 2013; Rees &amp; Roth, 2019; Scott et al., 2006; Wells &amp; Mejia Arauz, 2006), ideas can be transformed into deeper moments of sensemaking (Alexander, 2015; Resnick et al., 2010). Overly relying on low-level solicitations does not allow for sensemaking to take place (Carlone et al., 2011; Reinholz &amp; Shah, 2018). For students experiencing difficulty, holding low expectations about the level of sensemaking in which they can engage can have a significant impact on their learning outcomes as engaging in sensemaking has been found to play a significant role in science content learning (Cannady et al., 2019).</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Second, the results for the teacher evaluation dimension suggest there was not a significant difference between the ways teachers evaluated responses from students with and without difficulties. However, overall, teachers did tend to evaluate student responses more than not. In terms of students experiencing difficulty, teachers in the current study expressed beliefs that they needed confidence and providing students with evaluation that their response was “right” increased their confidence and their subsequent participation in discussions. This aligns with the research that suggests providing this formative feedback benefits students experiencing difficulty in science instruction (Therrien et al., 2011). However, evaluating student responses has implications for the sensemaking that can take place, by way of epistemic authority (whose knowledge is considered expert knowledge in the science classroom).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx2.p6">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">By focusing on providing students experiencing difficulty with an evaluation that their response is “right”, teachers are not giving them epistemic authority. Giving students epistemic authority allows for equitable sensemaking (Haverly et al., 2020). Haverly et al. (2020) describe one way teachers can support students’ epistemic authority is by inviting students to participate in classroom discourse. So, if students are not being given this opportunity, they are not being given equitable opportunities for sensemaking. In the current study the teacher held epistemic authority by overwhelmingly evaluating student responses. This is consistent with the literature that suggests that in science classrooms, it is often the teacher who holds the epistemic authority (Carlone et al., 2011). Science instruction that aligns with the current vision of science reform and current literature suggest that teacher evaluation of student ideas during discussions should be </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">non-evaluative</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> (Tytler &amp; Aranda, 2015). Bang et al. (2012) and Hand and Schoerning (2012) suggest that when teachers work to surface and clarify student ideas, which would have been considered non-evaluative in the current study, students have space to equitably participate in sensemaking. However, in the current study, opportunities for epistemic authority were not the norm for students experiencing difficulty.</span></p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Limitations</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Although there are several interesting outcomes from the current study, there are two main limitations to discuss: generalizability and opportunities for sensemaking that took place outside of whole-class discussion.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In terms of generalizability, due to the exploratory nature of the study, the sample in the current study was small (</span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">n</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> = 3). Furthermore, the sample was homogeneous. All three teachers in the current study identify as white females. While most of the teaching population is white (79.3%) and female (76%), the sample of teachers in the current study is not representative of the current teacher demographics in the United States (U.S. Department of Education, 2017). Due to the limitations, if this study were conducted with different teachers in different contexts, the results, findings, and outcomes may be different. Future iterations of this study could benefit from a larger sample size of a more diverse sample of teachers. A larger sample size with a more diverse sample of teachers would provide opportunities for broader generalizations and a richer understanding of the opportunities students experiencing difficulty have for sensemaking in general education science classrooms.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Second, in the current study, the focus was on whole-class discussions to look at the opportunities teachers afforded students experiencing difficulty for sensemaking. While the literature does suggest using whole-class discussions to promote collective sensemaking (Lemke, 1990; Michaels &amp; O’Connor, 2017; Zangori &amp; Pinnow, 2020), there are other instructional opportunities teachers use to promote sensemaking such as small group discussions or one-on-one discussions (Wright and Domke 2019; National Research Council, 2012). Focusing solely on opportunities for sensemaking in whole-class discussions rather than examining sensemaking opportunities happening in small groups or one-on-one could have impacted the data in terms of the frequency of opportunities offered to students experiencing difficulty. Future studies could examine other contexts for sensemaking to further examine sensemaking opportunities for this population of students.</span></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx7.SSx4">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Implications for Practice</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The current study was limited to three teachers, thus providing only some insight into teachers’ beliefs about students experiencing difficulty and the relationship between these beliefs and the opportunities these students have for sensemaking. However, a number of key ideas emerged from the study that are worthy of consideration. First, findings from this study suggest that teachers believe using talk for students experiencing difficulties sensemaking is useful, but they struggle to believe they can handle high-level solicitations and that they need responses evaluated during whole-class discussions. High-level solicitations and non-evaluative responses are critical in pushing the sensemaking of students during whole-class discussions (Schwarz et al., 2021). Therefore, teachers would benefit from professional learning opportunities focused on challenging their beliefs and supporting their practice during whole-class discussions. Research suggests that for teachers to address their belief systems they need to be made aware of their belief structures (Churchland &amp; Churchland, 2013).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx4.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Additionally, science teachers report feeling underprepared to teach science to students experiencing difficulty (Kahn &amp; Lewis, 2014). Knowing this, and adding what was learned in the current study, teachers need more support on ways to help their students experiencing difficulty feel more comfortable and confident to participate in discussions that will promote their sensemaking. Professional learning opportunities that focus on identifying barriers to participation (i.e., lack of confidence) and matching instructional strategies to remove barriers so students experiencing difficulty have equitable opportunities to participate in sensemaking is critical.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx4.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Second, because of the focus on teacher behavior and the role of the teacher in affording students experiencing difficulty opportunities for sensemaking with the science classroom, future research needs to focus on the teacher, starting with preservice training. Asking pre-service teacher preparation programs to examine the ways general education pre-service teachers are prepared to acknowledge and provide equitable instruction to students experiencing difficulty is critical. Historically, most general education pre-service teacher preparation programs spend extraordinarily little time on information related to students experiencing difficulty (Norman et al., 1998). This must be addressed for general education teachers to enter the classroom ready to notice and address the variability of learners that will be present in their science classrooms. Challenging deficit thinking is difficult but critical work.</span></p>
</div>

<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx7.SSx5">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Future Research</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The current study has expanded upon research on the opportunities made available to marginalized groups for sensemaking during whole-class discussions in science classrooms by specifically examining opportunities for students experiencing difficulty. Continuing this line of research is critical to supporting the success of this group of students, not just in the science classroom, but as they go out and use science to make sense of the world and make decisions that have impacts on themselves and those around them. To continue examining equity issues in science for students experiencing difficulty there are several avenues of research that could be explored.
Findings from this study suggest that there is a difference between the opportunities students with and without difficulties have for sensemaking. What is still unknown is what practices allow for more equitable participation from students experiencing difficulty during whole-class discussions. The current study is just a start to examining what is occurring in science classrooms for students experiencing difficulty and, therefore, there is need for further research that extends the current study. For example, researchers could begin by identifying teachers who have equitable instruction occurring in their classrooms. Then, digging deeper into the practices they use and structures they put in place that support equitable participation in sensemaking in their classrooms could help the field understand what practices and structures are needed to promote equitable sensemaking for students experiencing difficulty. In addition, identifying the teachers who have equitable instruction occurring in their classrooms and probing into their belief systems in terms of students experiencing difficulty could help gain an understanding of the kinds of beliefs teachers hold that may be predictive of equitable teaching practices.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx5.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The current study adds to existing literature on teacher beliefs about students experiencing difficulty. Research has been conducted regarding teacher beliefs about students experiencing difficulty learning science (i.e., Kahn &amp; Lewis, 2014) but no current studies exist that explore the relationship between teacher behavior and equitable science learning opportunities for this group of students. Exploring this relationship adds to simply collecting data on teacher beliefs by examining exactly what is happening in classrooms for students experiencing difficulty and making connections between what is happening and what teachers believe. Bryan (2012) suggested this avenue of inquiry regarding teacher belief research with a focus on sociocultural dimensions of beliefs. The current study examined the equity in sensemaking opportunities between students with and without difficulties thus beginning to explore this line of inquiry. The work of examining teacher beliefs in the context of what is happening in classrooms is important because ultimately the progress, achievement, and proficiency of students experiencing difficulty is impacted by teacher beliefs (Kiely et al., 2015) and the instructional opportunities they are afforded.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.SSx5.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The current study used equity analytics from the classroom observations during the teacher interviews to get teachers to interpret and reflect on their teaching practices related to sensemaking discussions and students experiencing difficulty. The teachers in the current study expressed how seeing the data was a helpful reflection tool and gave them ways to think about improving their practice. In the current study, the data analytics and reflections were only used at one timepoint. In future research, data analytics could be used at different timepoints throughout the school year to interpret, reflect, and analyze improvement in practice in terms of equitable opportunities for sensemaking. Similar work has been conducted with mathematics teachers (Reinholz &amp; Shah, 2018) and at the undergraduate teaching level (Ernest et al., 2019; Reinholz et al., 2019). However, providing this level of data and time for reflection could be powerful for K-12 teachers as they reflect upon their own instructional practices regarding the opportunities they afford students experiencing difficulty and could provide data on the ways equity analytics can change teachers’ implementation of equitable instructional practices over time.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx8.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Exploring the current reality for students experiencing difficulty in science is a critical first step in addressing equity issues for this group of students. Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods research design helped capture a robust picture of what opportunities are currently being afforded to students experiencing difficulty by examining what was currently occurring in middle school science classrooms and gaining further insight into the relationship between teacher beliefs, the instruction they provide, and their beliefs about the students they teach. Examining who participates and the ways in which teachers are soliciting students to participate in science discourse can help us understand the current reality for students experiencing difficulty and plan future research to support science teachers in delivering equitable instructional opportunities for this group of students. All students—including students experiencing difficulty —deserve equitable opportunities to learn and the support necessary to be successful.</span></p>
