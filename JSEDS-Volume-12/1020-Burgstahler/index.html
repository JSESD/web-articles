<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">This article reports the results of a retrospective survey of participants in an exemplary transition program for college-bound youth with disabilities. The study compared how male and female participants perceived changes in themselves in the areas of academic skills, social skills, Internet skills, levels of preparation for college and employment, levels of awareness of career options, and personal characteristics during the course of their participation; values of program components; and impact of program participation on their lives. In accordance with conventional gender stereotypes, significantly more boys indicated initial interests and/or career goals in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Financial security was reported by significantly more males and pursuit of independent living by significantly more females when asked about their primary motivation for seeking employment. Females perceived significantly greater changes in themselves than did males during the course of their participation. Girls reported that, prior to program participation, they perceived fewer career options than boys; by the time of the survey, females perceived more career options than males. Research results are of particular relevance to the preparation of girls with disabilities for college and careers, particularly in fields where they have been underrepresented.</span>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Individuals with disabilities are far less successful in school and employment than their peers without disabilities (Benz, Doren, &amp; Yavonoff, 1998; McNeil, 1997; National Organization on Disability, 2004). As high school support systems cease after graduation, many students with disabilities lack the selfdetermination, academic, transition, and independent living skills to succeed in college and careers. Consequently, fewer students with disabilities enroll and persist in postsecondary institutions than their peers without disabilities (Henderson, 2001; National Council on Disability and Social Security Administration, 2000; National Organization on Disability, 2004; Wagner, Newman, Cameto, &amp; Levine, 2005). This situation limits the success of people with disabilities in a world where completion of a postsecondary education is required for many lucrative careers.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Career achievements of some people with disabilities suggest that there is potential to increase their representation in STEM fields (Blumenkopf, Stern, Swanson, &amp; Wohlers, 1996; DO-IT, 2006; Unger, Wehman, Yasuda, Campbell, &amp; Green, 2001). High-tech careers are particularly accessible to individuals with disabilities because of advances in assistive technology that provide access to computers and scientific equipment. However, the inaccessible design of software, web pages, distance learning courses, and facilities continues to limit access to these fields (Burgstahler, 2002b; National Center for Education Statistics, 2000a, 2000b; Schmetzke, 2001).</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">FEMALES AND STEM</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Although their participation is increasing (National Science Foundation, 2007), the proportion of women in STEM fields falls below that of men (Galpin, Sanders, Turner, &amp; Venter, 2003; National Science Foundation, 2007; vanLangen &amp; Dekkers, 2006). Factors identified as contributors to this gender underrepresentation include discrimination, social pressure from parents and peers, and internalized negative attitudes and beliefs about mathematics (European Commission, 2001; Roger &amp; Duffield, 2000; Steele, 1997; Watt, 2005). Sex role stereotyping promotes the notion that boys are inherently better at math and have more use for math skills than girls (e.g., Eccles, 1994). Even girls who do well in mathematics often rate their math ability lower than do boys who perform at the same level (Kaminski, Erickson, Ross, &amp; Bradfield, 1976; Levine, 1976). Lower levels of self-perceptions in regard to their own math talent and expectations for mathematical success have been identified as strong contributors to girls’ lower participation in math (Eccles, 1994).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Research also suggests that women employed in STEM fields tend to experience gender discrimination that mirrors what is experienced in secondary and postsecondary school contexts (Kusk, Ozbilgin, &amp; Ozkale, 2007; Olubor, 2006). Interestingly, it has been found that in some socialist and formerly communist nations, perhaps due to emphasis on economic/gender equity, greater percentages of women are involved in STEM professions (Hanson, Schaub, &amp; Baker, 1996; Hanson, Fuchs, Aisenbrey, &amp; Kravets, 1999). In more Westernized nations, however, acceptance of stereotypes of females as less competent than men in STEM and of STEM as “too difficult” for females limits their exploration of careers in these fields (Greenfield, Peters, Lane, Rees, &amp; Samuels,
</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">2002; Roger &amp; Duffield, 2000; Seymour &amp; Hewitt, 1997; Steele, 1997; Watt, 2005) and contributes to gender inequity within STEM careers (Bianchini, Cavazos, &amp; Helms, 2000; Gurer &amp; Camp, 2002).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">A number of researchers have reported that adolescent girls lack self-confidence (Josephs, Markus, &amp; Tafarodi, 1992; Stipek &amp;
Gralinski, 1991; Takayoshi, Huot, &amp; Huot, 1999; Tenenbaum &amp; Leaper, 2003) and that lack of self-confidence is a driving force that leads many women to avoid male-dominated career fields (Gurer &amp; Camp, 2002). Other researchers have reported that relationships with others may be more central to the selfconcepts of women than of men (Miller, 1986; Roberts, 1991). Putting these together, the lack of availability of encouraging and supportive relationships or communities in STEM fields may have a disproportionately negative impact on women, as compared to men, who may have less need for this type of support yet more access to it (Bandalos, Yates, &amp; Thorndike-Christ, 1995; Gandhi, 2000).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Evidence suggesting the decline of gender differences in quantitative skills is encouraging (Friedman, 1989; Hyde, Fennema, and Lamon, 1990; National Science Foundation, 2007; Pajares &amp; Miller, 1994; Stumpf &amp; Stanley, 1996). Clearly, differing math achievement does not explain gender differences in participation in fields that require math skills.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Various programs have identified promising practices for bringing underrepresented groups—racial/</span>
<br class="ltx_break"/><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">ethnic minorities, women, and people with disabilities—into STEM fields. These include (a) hands-on science experiences, (b) work-based learning and research experiences, (c) summer bridge programs between academic levels, and (d) peer and mentor support (Benz et al., 1998; Cohen &amp; Light, 2000; Doren &amp; Benz, 1998; Leyser, Vogel, &amp; Wyland, 1998; National Science Foundation, 2001, 2005; Phelps &amp; Hanley-Maxwell, 1997; Ulki-Steiner, KurtzCostes, &amp; Kinlaw, 2000). Comprehensive projects that integrate a variety of interventions have been found to be more successful in recruiting and retaining students with disabilities in STEM fields than isolated efforts (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2001; National Science Foundation, 2005). One transition program that has implemented all of these strategies with students who have disabilities is the DO-IT Scholars program which is described in the next section. The research reported in this article compares the benefits of its specific interventions as perceived by female and male participants.</span></p>

It was selected for exploration in the current study because it (a) serves students with a wide range of disabilities; (b) has well-defined components that lend themselves to comparative analysis; and (c) has characteristics of successful programs that include longevity, prestigious awards, sustained operations, positive evaluation data, attention in the press, and ongoing support from funding agencies (e.g., Closing the Gap, 1995; Marmer, 1995; Roos, 1994–1995). Moreover, as a result of support from the National Science Foundation, it has produced a large number of participants interested in STEM fields (Burgstahler &amp; Chang, in press; Kim-Rupnow &amp; Burgstahler, 2004). Figure 1 describes key components of the DO-IT Scholars program.</span></p>

Results suggest that DO-IT may increase the STEM interests of individuals not initially interested in STEM, but that these individuals tend to value social opportunities more highly than those with STEM interests, who are more interested in technology-related activities.

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Given gender differences uncovered in the review of literature and analysis of Scholar email messages (Burgstahler &amp; Doyle, 2005), the researchers of the current study set out to examine whether the benefits of DO-IT activities were perceived differently by male and female participants. With funding from the NSF, further analysis of the data collected in the retrospective survey of DO-IT Scholars (Burgstahler &amp; Chang, in press; Kim-Rupnow &amp; Burgstahler, 2004) was conducted to address the following research questions.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">A total of 75 DO-IT participants completed the survey instrument used in the reported study (Kim-Rupnow &amp; Burgstahler, 2004). This final sample consisted of almost even numbers of male (52%) and female (48%) participants who were up to 26 years old (with 81% of age 18-23). Forty-two percent of the participants indicated a mobility/orthopedic impairment as their primary disability; the rest of the sample was fairly evenly divided with respect to sight, hearing, learning, and other disabilities. Ninety-one percent of the participants had graduated from high school at the time the survey was conducted. A profile of the participants is shown in Table 1.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The survey questionnaire created in an earlier study (Kim-Rupnow &amp; Burgstahler, 2004) included four sections: (a) demographic information, (b) Summer Study programs, (c) year-round computer and Internet activities, and (d) changes in Scholars as a result of participation. Demographic information collected ranged from age and gender to postsecondary education and employment (see Table 1). In the Summer Study section, respondents were asked to rate the value of program components such as college and career preparation on a scale ranging from 1 (not valuable at all) to 5 (extremely valuable). Using the same scale, in the year-round computer and Internet activities section, respondents were asked to rate the importance of activities such as online communication with peers and mentors; they also rated the value of both the Summer Study and yearround computer and Internet activities in developing their social, career, and academic skills. In the final section, respondents assessed their level of specific skills (e.g., selfadvocacy) at three different points in their lives–before participating in DO-IT, after the first Summer Study, and at the time of the survey. Statistical analyses provided both descriptive statistics—including frequency, cross-tabulation, and means—as well as inferential statistics, including Pearson’s Chisquare test, independent-samples t test, and mixed two-way repeated measures analyses of variance tests. For open-ended survey items, content analyses were performed to find general patterns in the narrative.</span></p>

Non-respondents were mailed a follow-up printed survey and a postage-paid return envelope. Seventy-five Scholars responded to the questionnaire (44 via web-based questionnaire, 3 via email, and 28 via postal mail), resulting in a 48% response rate.</span></p>

Table 2 shows the distribution patterns for the male and female participants. The patterns were similar between genders, with a disability related to mobility being the most common type of disability for both genders. Because of the low prevalence of types of disabilities other than mobility, these data were dichotomized (mobility vs. non-mobility disabilities) for analysis with Pearson’s Chisquare test. The test revealed no significant association between the type of disability and gender.</span></p>

As indicated in Table 2, sixty-two percent of the male participants expressed interests/strengths and or career goals in STEM. In contrast, only 38% of the female participants were STEM-oriented. Pearson’s Chi-square test confirms that this disproportionality is unlikely due to a chance distribution of males and females into the two groups, </span><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\textchi</span><sup class="ltx_sup"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">2</span></sup><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">(1, </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">N</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> = 73) = 3.95, </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">p</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> &lt; .05; significantly more males expressed interests/strengths and/or career goals in STEM fields and significantly more females expressed interests/strengths and/or career goals in non-STEM field</span></p>

In the area of perceived career options, the analysis revealed a significant overall effect of time, meaning that as a group the DO-IT participants were increasingly positive about the impact of DOIT activities on their perception of career options as their involvement in these activities progressed. However, the significant group by time interaction indicates that the growth in this perception was different for young men and young women participants (</span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">F</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">(2, 63) = 5.80, </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">p</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> &lt; .01).

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS </h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx11.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The current study compares how male and female participants in the DO-IT Scholars program perceive themselves and the impact of program participation. In accordance with conventional gender stereotypes, significantly more males than females indicated initial interests/ strengths and/or career goals in STEM fields and more males than females chose STEM fields as primary areas for postsecondary study. Whereas less than 40% of females indicated initial academic interests/strengths and/or career goals in STEM fields, almost half of the young women reported majoring in STEM postsecondary studies. Although it is unknown what role program interventions might have played, this finding suggests that career decisions are subject to influences and change as young adults engage in new experiences. As indicated in the literature review, factors contributing to the underrepresentation of females in STEM careers include lack of awareness of specific careers and educational requirements involved in pursuing them. For example, mathematics skills are needed for work in many STEM-related areas (Skolnick, Langbort, &amp; Day, 1982) and performance tests, graduate school exams, and civil service exams include questions measuring math skills (Kaminski et al., 1976). Even though lack of career awareness affects students of both genders, girls often suffer greater negative consequences than do boys because they are more likely to steer away from mathematics, physics, and science courses in high school (Watt, 2005). Additionally, often girls do not choose STEM because they do not perceive it to be socially meaningful and hence consider it of less value than do boys (Eccles, 1994). Accordingly, it has been suggested that making explicit connections between STEM fields and social values could heighten girls’ interests (Shanahan, 2006; Watt, 2005). All DO-IT interventions present STEM fields as accessible and socially meaningful and, in doing so, the program may have an impact on girls’ perceptions of studying and working in STEM fields. Girls reported fewer career options than boys prior to program participation; by the time of the survey, however, their perceived career options significantly increased and surpassed that of males, suggesting that the program may have impacted females more than males in this area. Such positive impact is also captured in qualitative data. For example, discoveries reported by females include “realizing that I had more career choices than I previously thought I had,” and “[DO-IT] showed me the career that I hope to go into.” Female participants also tended to perceive more improvement than did males in Internet skills, self-esteem, and social skills. Studies on gender equity in STEM education and careers often point out that girls and women face gender stereotyping with respect to STEM. For girls with disabilities, their own expectations and those of others regarding studying STEM may be even lower than for girls without disabilities since students with disabilities are less encouraged to pursue STEM than their peers without disabilities. Girls’ exposure to the engaging DO-IT program may stimulate self exploration and discovery. As one young woman reported, “I think the greatest impact [of DO-IT] for me is it [is] helping me to understand more about myself and the people in [the] real world. I have learned how to adapt to society without thinking that I am disable[d], I am useless.” Comments like this suggest that DO-IT participation may positively impact the self esteem of young women. DO-IT Scholars have credited the program with helping them gain a positive outlook on life and disabilities, and expand their social network. Similar program outcomes have been confirmed by parents (Burgstahler, 2002a) and suggest that the program may impact the overall wellbeing of participants. </span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx11.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Males and females in the current study differed in primary motivators for seeking employment. While financial security was reported by significantly more male students, pursuit of independent living was reported by more females. The pattern of differences poses interesting questions as the link between gender and career motivators is likely to be mediated through other variables such as socially-defined gender roles. For example, in the current society it may be that males generally feel more pressure than females to secure respectable salaries in order to support themselves and/or their families. Results suggest the importance of helping students develop practical skills in independent living and employment that can bring financial security.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH </h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx12.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Since DO-IT Scholar participants were not randomly selected, caution should be exercised in generalizing the results of this study to other populations. DO-IT participants are college-bound teens with disabilities who are motivated to participate in an extracurricular technology, academic, and career program that encourages consideration of STEM fields and who have supportive adults to assist with the application process. Results of this study should be interpreted in light of limitations reported in the earlier study (Kim-Rupnow &amp; Burgstahler, 2004).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx12.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Specifically, the response rate of the present study was 48%; a larger sample would have provided more power for analyses with multiple subgroups. Also, the impact of program components was based on the retrospective self-reporting of survey respondents. Their perceptions may not accurately reflect the actual impact of specific interventions due to potentially skewed recalls and subjectivity of self-assessment. Quantitative measures at actual points in time might provide stronger evidence of impact.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx12.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Current study results suggest important issues for further research. More longitudinal followup research on transition programs like DO-IT is needed since little of such data is currently available in published literature. Collection of data should occur at critical steps—such as before the Summer Study, immediately after the Summer Study, six months later, one year later, and several years later—in order to detect the long-term effect of program activities. A follow-up study could be designed to shed light on what interventions make some participants turn away from other interests and goals to pursue STEM studies and careers.

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx13.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The current study explored gender differences in participant perceptions of personal characteristics and of the value of transition program interventions. Females with disabilities tended to perceive greater and more pervasive changes in themselves when compared to males as their program involvement progressed. Their retrospective recollections of career options before participation were lower than those of males, however significantly greater levels of perceived career options were reported by women than men at the time of the survey, suggesting that program activities may have increased perceived career options for girls more than boys. Results also suggest that girls may benefit from interventions to prepare them for college and careers even more than boys and contributes to the body of evidence that supports the efficacy of interventions to increase the participation of women in STEM and other fields where they have been underrepresented. This study provides evidence-based direction to those seeking to enhance the academic and career selfconcepts, interests, and skills of women with disabilities, particularly in fields where they have been underrepresented. It suggests that when promoting STEM studies and careers for individuals with disabilities, programs should consider not only issues related to disability but also those related to gender.</span></p>
