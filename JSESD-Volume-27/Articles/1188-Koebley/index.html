<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">Inquiry learning through engagement with scientific practices has proven to be an effective instructional practice for general education students. Although students with complex support needs (CSN) are required to have access to the same grade-appropriate academic content in science as their peers without CSN, it remains a challenge for special education teachers to design instruction around student inquiry and science conceptual understanding. The 5E Science Education for Special Educators (5E-SESE) Model combines three well-established conceptual constructs (three-dimensional science standards, Universal Design for Learning [UDL], and the 5E Model) to support special educators in delivering quality science instruction. With the 5E Model at its center, 5E-SESE emphasizes the importance of students with CSN as active learners engaged in science practices. Three-dimensional content standards supported by UDL ensure rigor and accessibility for all students. This paper describes 5E-SESE and how it supports teachers’ design of effective science-inquiry instruction for students with CSN.<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_upright"></span></span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">For several decades, reform in science education has advocated for student inquiry in science classrooms (National Research Council [NRC], 2000, 2012). For students to fully understand scientific concepts, they must participate in the inquiry processes and discourse by which those science and engineering ideas were developed (NRC, 2012). These recommendations, along with the requirement that all students have access to the general education curriculum (Individuals With Disabilities Act [IDEA], 2004), have prompted a shift in instruction for students with complex support needs</span><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1" id="fn-ref-1">1</a><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> (CSN), that is, the approximately 1% of students for whom general, statewide assessments with accommodations do not produce valid evidence of what those students know and can do. For science instruction, inquiry learning through engagement with scientific practices is recommended as a primary strategy for general education students (Minner et al., 2010; Osborne, 2014), as well as for those with disabilities (Rizzo &amp; Taylor, 2016). What implications might the call for science-inquiry learning have for students with CSN and the teachers who support them?</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">Inquiry</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> is defined as learners asking important questions about the natural and designed world, gathering evidence to answer those questions through investigation, and then communicating their findings using that evidence (NRC, 2000). An effective approach to learning, inquiry science is also critical in developing citizens who are informed decision makers (Tan et al., 2023). However, scientific inquiry for students with CSN has been more difficult to define and operationalize. It remains a challenge for teachers to provide their students with CSN the required access to the same grade-appropriate academic content in science, including inquiry instruction, that is accessed by their peers in general education (Kuntz &amp; Carter, 2019; Petersen, 2016). This challenge exists in part due to the different theories of science learning that have guided reform in special education and general education classrooms (Taylor et al., 2020).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">This paper, building on recent promising results in the use of inquiry with students with CSN (Jimenez et al., 2021; Knight et al., 2020) and on robust findings of the use of learning-cycle models with general education students (Minner et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2015), introduces a model for teachers of students with CSN that situates student inquiry and science conceptual understanding at its center. We describe the three conceptual constructs that comprise the 5E Science Education for Special Educators (5E-SESE) Model, the rationale for their inclusion, and how the model supports special educators in their design of quality science instruction for students with CSN.</span><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2" id="fn-ref-2">2</a><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"></span></p>

<section class="ltx_section" id="Sx2">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">BACKGROUND: SCIENCE INSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS WITH COMPLEX SUPPORT NEEDS</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In the years following IDEA (2004), reforms aimed at providing access to the general education curriculum for students with CSN typically targeted the skills needed to support learning in functional life-skills domains (Browder et al., 2004). Legislation (Every Student Succeeds Act, 2015) requires that content standards for assessments for students with CSN be based on alternate achievement standards that align with the grade-level content standards for all students. Enacted curriculum studies in the years following passage of the legislation, however, indicated that teacher expectations for students’ learning were limited, often resulting in science instruction that was not age appropriate (Karvonen et al., 2013) and focused primarily on skills needed for daily living rather than on more rigorous academics.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">While there have been increasing calls for students with CSN to be able to use science practices to demonstrate understanding of science concepts (Andersen &amp; Nash, 2016), an ongoing divide exists between the underlying theories of science learning in special education and those in general education. Sociocultural and cognitive models emphasize learning that occurs in a social context (e.g., inclusion models, incorporating students’ environments and interests) that encourages students to construct meaning for themselves (including through methods such as inquiry). These models undergird inquiry-based methodologies that led to science reform within general education (McGinnis &amp; Kahn, 2014). Yet, special education research has been dominated by behaviorist-oriented studies that define learning in terms of student mastery of specific skills and information (McGinnis &amp; Kahn, 2014). While inquiry instruction remains the gold standard for science instruction in general education classrooms (Osborne, 2014), students with disabilities, who typically require more structured learning environments, learn science concepts most often through direct and explicit instruction (Rizzo &amp; Taylor, 2016).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Although shifts towards an academic focus have occurred recently for students with CSN (Spooner &amp; Browder, 2015), science instruction has typically been either embedded within functional-curriculum objectives (e.g., making decisions about safety, health, and nutrition in daily activities) or implemented using explicit systematic instruction to elicit desired student responses for the measurable outcomes being targeted (e.g., recall of vocabulary, successful completion of steps to conduct an experiment) (Spooner et al., 2011).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Recent studies report evidence of improved achievement for students with disabilities (including students with intellectual disabilities and Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) when inquiry instruction was implemented (Rizzo &amp; Taylor, 2016). Instruction informed by inquiry approaches such as use of the scientific method or a learning cycle (Bybee et al., 2006) were effective for students with disabilities when they were implemented with some components of explicit instruction (Rizzo &amp; Taylor, 2016). Similarly, a review of adjacent literature on science instruction for students with ASD (where inquiry included student observation, experimentation, and reasoning) found that students benefitted from the use of inquiry methods (e.g., hands-on exploration) and with support using direct instruction (Barnett et al., 2018).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Knight et al. (2020) summarized research focused on learning both science content and science practices for students with intellectual disabilities and ASD (students with CSN represented a subset of those students included within studies in the review). They found that use of science practices led to increased student ability to generalize certain science concepts (e.g., living things are alive). Students with CSN have also been able to successfully engage in inquiry by asking more in-depth questions in science units focused on developing engineering habits of mind (Jimenez et al., 2021). Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles provided the construct needed for the teachers in this study to reduce barriers and increase access to inquiry for this population of students.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p6">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Although Apanasionok et al.’s (2019) recent literature review reported that a preponderance of evidence supports behavioral approaches (e.g., systematic instruction) in science as effective for students with CSN, the study’s authors acknowledge that the dominant paradigm in U.S. special education research has been conducted within a dedicated but small research community. These studies and others (Taylor et al., 2020) call for broader definitions of effective science instruction for students with CSN that allow for inclusion of a wider range of strategies, including strategies (like inquiry-oriented approaches and UDL-focused adaptations) that have been used successfully in general education classrooms.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">PREPARING SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS FOR A NEW MODEL IN SCIENCE INSTRUCTION</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Students with CSN are most often taught in segregated settings (Andersen &amp; Nash, 2016) by special educators who do not have licensure or extensive preservice training in science academic content (Osborne, 2014). Given the shifts toward more inquiry-focused academic instruction, special educators are required to fulfill increasingly complex roles in service of students with CSN. While most preservice special educator programs include a focus on specially designed instruction with adaptations and supports, the planning of inquiry-based instruction using newer multidimensional standards and UDL is likely neither included nor intuitive (van Garderen et al., 2020). When academic-content-area coursework is included, it is more likely to address literacy and numeracy content than science concepts (Leko et al., 2015). While alternate science-content standards outlining grade-appropriate academic content for students with CSN have been written, designing inquiry-oriented instruction using those standards is challenging to implement (Petersen, 2016).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Special education teachers, all of whom have varying preparation levels and experiences, need to design and deliver specialized instruction to address diverse learning goals (e.g., priority goals of communication, social skills, life skills) balanced with required academic content for students with CSN (Root et al., 2017). These complexities present a challenge to teachers as they align individual student needs with instructional priorities, especially given limited instructional time.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">This paper introduces a model that supports inquiry science instruction of students with CSN. The 5E-SESE Model supports teachers in applying inquiry-based teaching strategies to robust science content with their students (Karvonen et al., 2024). While other recent studies have proposed inquiry learning as an organizing principle for multiple constructs (Molebash et al., 2019), the 5E-SESE Model defines an inquiry-oriented organization of components inclusive of UDL-focused instruction for students with CSN. We describe how the component parts of each of the three conceptual constructs support inquiry learning for students with CSN and provide an example of how teachers have used the model to guide their design of inquiry-oriented science instruction.

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">A CONCEPTUAL MODEL: SCIENCE-INQUIRY INSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS WITH CSN</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The 5E-SESE Model builds teacher knowledge of inquiry instruction for students with CSN, continuing a shift toward strategies that prioritize student conceptual understanding in science. This model builds on studies that use UDL principles to support inquiry-based science instruction for students with and without disabilities (Hanuscin &amp; van Garderen, 2020; Sebti &amp; Damiani, 2021).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The 5E-SESE Model (Figure 1) situates the 5E Instructional Model at its center to emphasize the focus on inquiry, with students as active participants in scientific processes. The 5E Instructional Model (Bybee, 2014) consists of five instructional phases (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate) that form a learning cycle. While multidimensional standards guide the concepts and skills to include in science instruction, the 5E model provides a structure for how learners can engage deeply with that content. With a substantial body of evidence showing that inquiry-based instructional strategies increase students’ conceptual understanding of science ideas (Minner et al., 2010), models like the 5E model provide a foundation and a starting place for shifts toward instruction that expect active student thinking and engagement.</span></p>

</figure>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Within the 5E-SESE Model, the 5E inquiry cycle is supported by three-dimensional science content standards (Figure 1, Arrow 1). Including standards with a full slate of core content, science practices, and crosscutting concepts assures that students with CSN are offered access to the same rigorous standards as their general education peers. The standards also offer extensive opportunities for student engagement as they connect science learning with experiences of their immediate surroundings and personal space (Bybee, 2014).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">UDL principles also support the 5E inquiry cycle (Figure 1, Arrow 3), providing guidelines to identify barriers and design solutions during instruction. Both constructs emphasize student engagement; the Engage 5E phase uses students’ interests and prior knowledge as a first step in inquiry. The UDL engagement principle recognizes that not all students approach learning in the same way, supporting early identification of potential barriers in instructional planning with the ultimate goal of providing diverse means for students to interact with content, their peers, and their teachers (Israel et al., 2018; Thomas et al., 2018). Similar mutual connections occur between the other phases of the 5E model and the UDL guidelines of Action/Expression and Representation (e.g., identifying alternate ways to communicate findings in an Explain phase, including additional methods for gathering data in an Explore phase). Using different combinations of the constructs’ component parts in this way demonstrates the multiple ways inquiry can be enacted (connecting different elements of UDL and the 5E model) as opposed to defining one single correct approach.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Three-dimensional science-content standards and UDL also have complementary components that support the 5E inquiry cycle (Figure 1, Arrow 2). UDL guidelines for creating engaging and accessible learning experiences (CAST, 2018) align with the science practices’ emphasis on the use of scientific models, investigations, and discourse about ideas (Summy &amp; Fetters, 2018). The crosscutting concepts’ (CCCs) progression of major conceptual ideas supports the UDL principle of providing multiple means of representation through encouraging use of graphic organizers, assistive technology, or scaffolding. The CCCs also give students broad categories around which to ask questions and convey their knowledge using UDL-based approaches like explicit strategy teaching, thus providing multiple means of action and expression (Hebert et al., 2018).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p6">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The 5E-SESE Model integrates three well-researched constructs that support teachers in designing effective instruction. The 5E model, supported by robust science content and UDL-based adaptations that reduce learning barriers, defines 5E-SESE (Figure 1, Arrow 4). Each of the three constructs is described in more detail in the sections that follow.</span></p>

For each EE, the learning map defines a path toward the EE’s learning target(s) using nodes that reduce complexity even further.

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">UDL, in support of inquiry learning, is an essential component of the 5E-SESE Model. The goal of UDL is to “develop expert learners who are, each in their own way, resourceful and knowledgeable, strategic and goal-directed, purposeful and motivated” (CAST, 2018, FAQ section, para. 1). UDL addresses this goal through three principles that support the design of the most accessible experience or content for learners. The principles are organized into guidelines to articulate further the why, what, and how of learning, as well as strategies for students to access, build, and internalize the learning (CAST, 2018). Each guideline is further divided into checkpoints that suggest how teachers can teach that guideline. The checkpoints are not exhaustive; rather, they are ideas, plans, or actions that serve as a basis for developing learning options and supports for all students.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The first UDL principle articulates strategies to assure that all students are engaged with learning and includes three guidelines: recruiting interest, sustaining effort and persistence, and self-regulation. Providing multiple means of representation for all learners is the second UDL principle and includes the guidelines of perception, language and symbols, and comprehension. Finally, the third principle describes multiple means of action and expression for learners to show what they know and can do and includes options for physical action, expression and communication, and executive functions.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">UDL principles and guidelines can support science learning through hands-on investigations, scientific discourse, and community-based instruction (Hebert et al., 2018; Summy &amp; Fetters, 2018); they also can create accessible learning opportunities for all students, with and without disabilities, increasing opportunities for scaffolding and reducing barriers to learning. Recent studies have shown promise using universally designed engineering instruction for students with CSN. Researchers used UDL principles to adapt a high-quality, general-education engineering curriculum for students with CSN. Setting self-determination goals involving initiation, thinking, and collaboration; students’ ability to ask substantial questions improved over the course of the study (Jimenez et al., 2021). UDL has also been used to mediate the significant language demands of learning science for students with disabilities (Thomas et al., 2018) and in teaching engineering concepts to students with ASD (Kouo et al., 2021).</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The 5E-SESE Model is based on learning theory which holds that people reinterpret, redefine, reorganize, elaborate, and change conceptual understanding as they interact with their surroundings (Bybee et al., 2006). By interpreting phenomena through the lens of their experiences, learners develop the knowledge and expertise necessary for them to understand and engage with the world around them (NRC, 2012).</span></p>

Each phase has a specific function that supports inquiry instruction. In the Engage phase, teachers motivate students to want to learn about a topic, while also learning what students already know about the topic. Students pose questions about phenomena in which they have interest. During the Explore phase, students participate in hands-on activities to observe a phenomenon, collect data, and test out varying designs or variables. Data is analyzed and scientific vocabulary is used to describe findings and make claims during the Explain phase. In the Elaborate phase, students ask related questions or apply their learning about a science concept to another context. Finally, student understanding is assessed during the Evaluate phase. Teachers enable and guide inquiry throughout all five phases, offering varying levels of guidance as students gain understanding and construct meaning for themselves (Bybee, 2014).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Studies of the 5E model indicate many positive effects on student learning and increasing student interest in science (Bybee et al., 2006; Bybee, 2014; Minner et al., 2010). 5E instruction challenges students’ existing understandings and knowledge, allows for the reconstruction of false assumptions (Bybee, 2014; Ruiz-Martín &amp; Bybee, 2022), and promotes deep learning that is grounded in students’ personal experiences (Concannon &amp; Brown, 2017).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx3.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The model requires adaptation to support conceptual learning for students with CSN. Several studies have found that explicit instruction embedded within a guided-inquiry approach increased students’ science learning outcomes, including in students with learning disabilities (Rizzo &amp; Taylor, 2016). Instructional approaches of this type represent a shift in thinking about how students with disabilities learn and how they can be expected to engage with academic content. Successful use of instructional strategies—like guided inquiry with hands-on activities, spatial organizers, peer mediation, and formative feedback (Therrien et al., 2014; Toma, 2022)—have expanded special education research beyond the well-established literature on behaviorist-focused instruction.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx3.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Some aspects of the 5E-SESE Model are supported for instruction of students with disabilities (Sebti &amp; Damiani, 2021; van Garderen et al., 2020). In literacy, for example, approaches in science writing have been shown to be effective in providing access to argument-based science inquiry for students with disabilities (Taylor et al., 2018). Students with moderate- to severe-intellectual disabilities were able to ask scientific questions, make observations, design and carry out investigations, and draw conclusions using electronic devices in an adapted 5E approach (Miller et al., 2013). Likewise, So et al.’s (2022) adapted 5E instructional model allowed students with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities to actively engage with STEM learning through technology exploration, explaining for understanding, and engineering innovation.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx3.p6">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">While inquiry instruction is a common strategy for science, it is not often used when teaching students with CSN. Teachers must have knowledge of science content and of how to engage students with disabilities effectively with these concepts, as well as tools for addressing the barriers their students will face in inquiry-oriented instruction (Israel et al., 2018). Using the 5E-SESE Model, special education research can be expanded to focus on how to apply UDL-infused science-inquiry methodologies with students who have CSN.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The 5E-SESE Model operationalizes the three constructs described above for instruction in science content (rigorous three-dimensional standards), inquiry-based science teaching pedagogy (the 5E model), and ensuring accessibility for all learners (UDL). Ultimately, the goal of inquiry-focused instruction is for students with CSN to be able to construct meaning and communicate about solutions to authentic problems (Kouo et al., 2021) as they develop increased autonomy, capacity for self-advocacy, and human connection (Erickson &amp; Koppenhaver, 2020).

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx5.SSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The 5E-SESE Model is based on the philosophy that a UDL-supported 5E approach to inquiry teaching and learning is an effective organizer for special educators’ design and planning of science instruction. The convergence points of the three constructs represent opportunities for teachers to think about science instruction in innovative ways. For example, cognitive themes (e.g., cause and effect, patterns, change over time) and science practices (e.g., questioning, investigating, modeling) represented by dimensions in the science standards increase options for access and engagement for students with CSN (Figure 1, Arrow 2). Similarly, the UDL guidelines are themselves a starting point for planning instruction that is accessible, engaging, and challenging (Ruhter, 2022). There is great benefit in designing instruction that addresses learning variability from the onset rather than retrofitting adaptations for specific learners into developed lessons, particularly in the context of science-lesson planning for students with CSN (Jimenez, 2020).</span></p>

The course includes a step-by-step lesson-planning approach to assist teachers in creating instruction that is tailored to student strengths, interests, and needs (Karvonen et al., 2024).

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx6.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Using science content from the three dimensions represented in the K–12 Science Framework, the 5E-SESE Model is designed to support a new approach to science instruction for students with CSN. With inquiry at the center of the model in the form of the 5Es, teachers are supported as they design robust science instruction supported by UDL principles. Our work builds on promising results in the use of inquiry with students with disabilities (Jimenez et al., 2021; So et al., 2022) and extends prior research integrating 5E, UDL, and formative assessment approaches (van Garderen et al., 2020) to provide a model specifically aimed at supporting teachers in designing science-inquiry instruction for students with CSN. The model also builds on studies that shift emphasis for students with CSN from skill-based science instruction to strategies aimed at students’ conceptual understanding (Jimenez et al., 2021; Knight et al., 2020).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx6.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The project supports the use of robust science standards and inquiry instruction that benefit not only students with CSN but also likely will provide more-accessible strategies for all learners (Rose et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2018), including those who are underrepresented in STEM professions (Clements et al., 2021). Natural overlaps between the NGSS and UDL provide opportunities for underserved populations to have increased access to rigorous science coursework, regardless of differences in culture, language, or academic ability (Rudenstine et al., 2018).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx6.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">As more learning opportunities for students with CSN are envisioned and carried out successfully, the shift in classroom and research emphasis from skill-oriented instruction to strategies involving inquiry and conceptual understanding becomes more viable. With research continuing to bolster the learning theories behind the three constructs in our model, this project outlines an approach to science instruction that serves the unique learning needs of students with CSN.</span></p>

We recognize and build on research for this population that includes students with severe intellectual disability, significant cognitive disabilities, extensive support needs, autism, or multiple disabilities. In this paper, students with CSN includes all students with disabilities that significantly impact their intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior (Nash &amp; Bechard, 2016).</span></p><p class="footnote" id="fn-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-ref-2">2</a><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">2</span></span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">5E-SESE is a professional development project that uses the same 3-construct model to both guide teacher learning and support student inquiry. This paper focuses on how the model supports student inquiry. See Karvonen et al., 2024 for a description of the 5E-SESE professional development approach.</span></p></section></div>
