<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">When you don’t have a hand, what could you have instead? This article introduces the impact of inviting youth with disabilities to learn tools and technology to design their own solutions and advocate for their own future. This approach to programming is rooted in a mindset of designing WITH, not FOR. Not only are design outcomes improved when users are incorporated into the process, but this approach has been shown to improve confidence in creating one’s own solutions. These programs include hands-on “design-your-own-body-mod” workshops, as well as a budding inclusive design consultancy led by youth with disabilities. Through this programming, youth not only develop technical and cutting edge skills, confidence, and meaningful solutions, but they also develop a clearer understanding of design and engineering career paths and establish their own network of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) professionals.</span>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Global companies such as Microsoft, Nike, and Target have increasingly produced adaptive and inclusive lines of products. This has been the result of a growing trend within business and design industries towards inclusion of people with a broader range of abilities (Pullin, 2011). While this trend is well-intended, it often falls short in its execution. This is because the field of design - which is widely acknowledged as lacking in its diversity - designs </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">for</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> users from different demographics, rather than designing </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">with</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> them (Holmes, 2020). User research methodologies and user testing are inadequate when compared with the value of lived experience: they are insights filtered and applied through another’s lens.
</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The benefits of making products and services inclusive reach beyond the disability community. They support people with temporary disabilities (like a broken arm), and situational disabilities (holding a baby in one arm) as well (Holmes, 2020).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">People with disabilities are capable of designing their own solutions. More designers who have disabilities will mean more successfully inclusive solutions.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">It is not uncommon for products and programs intended for people with disabilities to try to “fix the problem”. This perpetuates a cultural bias of problematizing disabled bodies, and disempowering dynamic that situates them as recipients of aid.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">BOOST Workshops intend to shift this dynamic by empowering participants to create a vision for themselves, and by inviting them to explore practical solutions as well as whimsical and playful expressions of themselves. They also intend to expose youth with disabilities to the design process in a meaningful and experiential way to improve their self-advocacy through tools of design and potentially inspire an interest in a future STEAM career.</span></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ltx_section" id="Sx2">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">PURPOSE</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Many programs around disability seek to “fix” that disability. These types of programs focus on deficits and forefront limitations. This mindset can be restricting and disempowering for participants and it can create a “savior” dynamic for program leads. Additionally, it is not uncommon for these types of programs to be run by individuals who do not share the lived experience of participants. This can create a lack of understanding and well-intentioned, but tone-deaf solutions. These programs can feel more like rehab or occupational therapy, rather than a place to live and thrive.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">This program, by contrast, celebrates the bodies that participants are in. Rather than focus on deficits, it invites participants to enhance their body, however their body is. Through this process, participants realize that they can have agency in creating their own solutions, with access to tools and a network to do so in a robust way. It also allows participants to learn about their interests and to develop tangible products that could help themselves and others.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Programs like this can broaden the participants’ horizons on what they can do for their future by introducing them to the world of STEAM and design. They are able to learn about STEAM and design careers through hands-on experiences and exposure to professionals in those industries. This also allows design professionals the opportunity to collaborate with youth and learn from them, as they approach the creative process in different and unexpected ways. With this approach, there is no middle man, and the products created better serve their intended audience.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">APPROACH</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">These project-based intensive BOOST workshops were developed to prompt an open-ended question to youth with upper limb differences: if you don’t have a hand, what could you have instead? Rather than problematize participants’ bodies and focus on developing “solutions” to “fix the problem,” this experimental approach invited exploration and play through design and prototyping.</span></p>
</div>
<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx3.SSx1">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Facilitator’s Mindset</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Leading design workshops requires a shift to a facilitator’s mindset. In this role, it is important to provide structure at the beginning to get participants engaged, and then allow them to develop their own concepts. Facilitators listen deeply without judgement and ask questions rather than providing answers. They encourage participants and provide support when needed, and always ensure safe practices are being used as participants build their prototypes. Facilitators embrace any unexpected events that occur, and invite participants to do the same.</span></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx3.SSx2">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Creating the Right Environment</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In BOOST Workshops, establishing an environment that encourages creativity is essential. This is done using mechanisms such as presenting low barriers to entry, cultivating a “Yes, And” culture, leveling the playing field between participants, respecting participants’ ideas and decisions, being present and able to adapt, relying on active hands-on activities, and learning by doing. In BOOST Workshops, participants never start with a blank page: using the right balance of constraints and open-endedness is best for supporting creative outcomes.</span></p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Helpful Frameworks</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">For people who are unaccustomed to the design process, these frameworks can be useful for understanding how to set a design project up for success.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Professionals who come from disciplines that prioritize linear thinking and problem solving often question the value of exploring and brainstorming ideas that are impossible or impractical. However, this open exploration of the possibilities is an indispensable step in the design process and in developing unexpected solutions. The following frameworks intend to demystify the value of exploring ideas and bring awareness to interactions that benefit different stages of the design process.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Figure 1 shows a framework that compares a linear problem solving approach with a creative problem solving approach. As is shown in Figure 1 (Petrides et al, 2020), the linear problem solving approach progresses from question to answer. This linear process is driven by constraints and limitations of what </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">cannot</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> happen. Alternatively, the creative problem solving approach is driven by </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">opportunities</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> and the exploration of possibilities. Unrealistic or impossible ideas can seed an inspiration for someone else. From there, these ideas can be reconciled with reality and constraints. This is the heart of the design process: taking a fantastic possibility and turning it into a realistic solution. These solutions are more likely to be innovative as compared with a linear answer.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">If Figure 1 is about the general arc of the process, Figure 2 is about interactions and reactions to others who are involved with the process. Figure 1 and Figure 2 both address bringing awareness to one’s approach in order to be more open to ideas and exploration early in the design process.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Figure 2 shows The Six Thinking Hats (De Bono, 1999), a useful framework for one’s mindset and interactions during the design process. All of these Thinking Hats are necessary. They are useful at different </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">stages</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> of the design process and should be “worn” intentionally.</span></p>

Different “hats” are beneficial during different stages of the design process.

</figure>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p6">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">BLACK hats are commonly “worn” by linear thinkers. If “worn” during early ideation, BLACK hats will result in a linear problem solving approach. If a creative problem solving approach is desired, BLACK hats are counterproductive during this early phase. They are useful in later stages of the design process when ideas are being narrowed and refined.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p7">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">GREEN and YELLOW hats should be “worn” for generative ideation and brainstorming, particularly in the early ideation stages of the design process. This promotes open exploration of possibilities and encourages ideas to build off of one another.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p8">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">It is often helpful to have shared language to discuss what is happening at a given time during the design process. There are a number of design processes that exist and most are fairly comparable. Figure 3 shows the author’s design process that is used in BOOST Workshops. It consists of nine non-linear components that can occur simultaneously and repeat throughout the process.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Many educators are inclined to bring this project type and approach into their K-12 classroom which does not include any or many youths with disabilities. This can be problematic and is not recommended for a few reasons. It can create a dynamic of designing FOR and not WITH.
First, it can reinforce an imbalanced and disempowering dynamic, where the able-bodied youth are the “helpers” and the youth with a disability is the one being “helped.” Second, while the able-bodied youth might feel positive about the solution they create, it may be built on false assumptions and not actually be useful or desirable for its recipient.
These challenges may be addressed. For example, able-bodied youth may begin by designing for themselves, based on their own needs. They may collaborate as equal partners with a youth with a disability, and perhaps even design solutions for each other (so the able-bodied youth receives a prototype from the youth with a disability, and vice-versa).</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">While a range of formats have been tested from pop-up public engagements to 5-day intensives, the most effective format has been found to be the 5-day intensive, which will be the focus of this section. Although this 5-day format is preferred, it is not always feasible. There are still lessons to be learned from it, and less intensive methods may be used.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx7.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">These workshops typically engage 6-10 participants ages 10-18, and attempt to maintain a 1:1 ratio of participants to facilitators. Participants have included youth with upper and lower limb differences, and wheelchair users, and they are recruited through support organizations and healthcare providers. While BOOST Workshops engage participants with physical disabilities, they were developed for youth with any level of ability. Rather than focus on deficits, they invite participants to create something to enhance their body, however their body is.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Day 1 + Day 2 focus on creating the right environment, exploring ideas, and learning tools and technology. Tools and technologies taught have ranged from 3D scanning, modeling, and printing, to plaster casting, to sewing, to basic electronics. Days 3 + 4 are dedicated to developing ideas and building prototypes with the tools available. Participants generally work intensively with facilitators on these days on their individual projects. On Day 5, participants finalize their prototypes and give a public presentation on their work. This presentation is essential not only to serve as a hard deadline for prototype completion, but also as an opportunity to reflect on and celebrate participant’s work and inspire attendees.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx7.p6">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">At the end of each workshop, participants may choose to be partnered with design and engineering professionals for 4-6 months to continue developing their prototype. These groups generally begin by establishing goals and expectations. They typically meet on a weekly basis to collaborate on the project. In these collaborations, the youth continues to drive the design vision, and the facilitator may challenge ideas or push them further, and support with the more technical production of the final prototype. These collaborations generally culminate in another final public presentation.</span></p>

The goal of the consultancy is to amplify disabled voices and perspectives in the design process, shifting perceptions around inclusion and increasing visibility in society as a whole.

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">DISCUSSION</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The BOOST approach to programming is rooted in a mindset of designing WITH, not FOR, as participants with disabilities are taught technical and design skills and supported in creating their own solutions. This approach exposes participants to careers in STEAM, which raises awareness about those career paths as students develop one-on-one relationships with professionals in those fields. STEAM careers - and more particularly, engineering and design - play a powerful role in shaping our world in a tangible way: they create the built environment we live in and the objects with which we interact. Not only are design outcomes improved when end users are incorporated into the process, but this approach has been shown to improve confidence in creating one’s own solutions. If individuals with disabilities see that STEAM skills and careers can directly affect their lives and the lives of others in a beneficial way, it will become a more diverse field with more practitioners from the disability community. This would result in increased inclusion in our society as a whole: those individuals will inherently develop more inclusive and accessible solutions in the mainstream that they themselves are able to use.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx5.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The world is evolving and mindsets need to evolve too. Society has a history of telling people with disabilities that “they can’t” - in doing so, it strips away agency and views them as a burden. This must change and society needs to see people with disabilities differently. They must be viewed as people who can not only contribute, but who can offer unique insights and perspectives to drive meaningful and necessary societal change.</span></p>
