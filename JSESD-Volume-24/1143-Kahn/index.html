<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The underrepresentation of persons with disabilities in STEM reflects not only a moral failing in society’s commitment to equity but also a practical dilemma as science benefits from the contributions of people with diverse perspectives. While teacher education programs attempt to address equity at the K-12 level, societal biases and misconceptions about who is “able” in science present persistent barriers for people with disabilities throughout the STEM pipeline, in higher education, employment, and beyond. How can we ensure that students with disabilities will encounter professors, employers, coworkers, and peers who are supportive of their efforts in STEM? To address this question, this article describes the experience of a college administrator and four undergraduate students who collaboratively conducted a literature review on inclusive STEM education during the summer of 2020. While the goal of this project was to provide meaningful summer learning opportunities and employment for students during COVID-19 while simultaneously providing research support for the administrator, project outcomes suggest that the college students, none of whom were education majors, gained understanding and appreciation of the issues surrounding inclusive STEM education while also developing expertise in the literature review process. We suggest that this project represents a successful teaching technique that can be used in higher education, including teacher education programs, to contribute to the development of future leaders, educators, and citizens who are aware of, engaged with, and supportive of quality inclusive STEM education and opportunities for all.</span>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Persons with disabilities are underrepresented in science and engineering (National Science Foundation, 2019). On its face, this inequity reflects a failing in society’s ability, and perhaps commitment, to nurturing the interests, talents, and opportunities for all people in STEM. It also represents a loss for the field, for even a cursory review of scientists with disabilities attests to the fact that science benefits from having people with diverse perspectives contribute to scientific discovery. Among the most vexing barriers are societal biases about who is “able” (Michigan State University, 2019) and “who can do science” that persist all along the STEM pipeline, in schooling, employment, and beyond (Cech &amp; Waidzunas, 2018).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">While teacher preparation programs attempt to achieve the promise of equitable and excellent science education for all articulated in national science education policies (National Research Council, 2012; NGSS Lead States, 2013), one must question the effectiveness of such efforts if the greater society beyond the field of K-12 education continues to harbor misconceptions about people with disabilities in STEM. How can we ensure that students with disabilities will encounter professors, employers, coworkers, and peers who are supportive of their efforts in STEM? Moreover, how can we create a society where leaders in </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">all</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> fields are committed to the worthy cause of “STEM for All?”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">To address these questions, this “Teaching Techniques” article describes the experience of a college administrator (first author) with expertise in science teacher education and four undergraduate liberal arts students (co-authors) at a major university in the northeastern United States who collaboratively conducted a literature review on inclusive STEM education during the summer of 2020. While the initial goal of this project was to provide meaningful summer learning opportunities and employment for students during COVID-19 while simultaneously providing research support for the administrator, project outcomes suggest that the college students, none of whom were education majors, gained understanding and appreciation of the issues surrounding inclusive STEM education while also developing expertise in the literature review process. These outcomes were quite surprising given that literature reviews are typically conceptualized as vehicles for understanding what is known in a particular field (Jesson, et al., 2011) rather than as a focal point for pedagogy. Therefore, we suggest that this project represents a successful teaching technique that can easily be applied to STEM, STEM education, and/or Special Education (SPED) programs by integrating small literature review groups, either within the curriculum or co-curricularly, in order to raise awareness of and sensitivity to quality science education for all students. Tips for doing so are included in the Recommendations section of the article. As this is a practitioner article, we focus on the step-by-step process by which we worked through our project, using narrative style to engage readers and “bring them along” through our journey. We begin with the first author’s project overview, then move to the student voices, and finally we present a synthesis of what we learned, providing recommendations for the use of literature review groups in teacher education and liberal arts and sharing what we see as possible next steps for the field.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">FORMING A RESEARCH GROUP DURING THE SUMMER OF COVID-19</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">I (Sami - first author) work at a major U.S. university where I lead an entity whose mission is to advance STEM literacy through course development, co-curricular programming, and research. During the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted our semester and forced all teaching and most other university endeavors to an online environment. At around the time we went online, I had begun to outline plans for an integrative literature review on science education for students with exceptionalities, the latter term being defined as students who are viewed as having disabilities or as being gifted. This review would serve as the basis for a chapter which I planned to write for a major handbook on science education research. When I learned that many students’ summer employment and travel plans were cancelled due to the pandemic, I began to think about ways to include students in my research. At first, this seemed like a daunting task because our university doesn’t have a college of education, and so I knew that I wouldn’t be able to find students with strong backgrounds in education theory or research. That said, as I have mentored many students through research projects in education, I believed that I could develop a “mini-curriculum” to provide students with adequate background to accomplish our work while also familiarizing them with inclusive STEM approaches.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">I began by posting an ad on our university’s student employment site for the position(s). I had funding for up to four students, but I wasn’t sure whether many students would be interested in this type of commitment over the summer. To my surprise and delight, 16 students applied, and so I began the challenging task of narrowing down the applicant pool. Ultimately, I selected the four students who conveyed genuine interest in the research topic and who demonstrated curiosity by doing some background research in preparation for the interview (e.g., looking at our website, reading a relevant article) and/or asking pertinent questions. Of the four students, two were rising sophomores and two were rising juniors. Their majors were: Civil and Environmental Engineering, History, History of Science/Chemistry, and Molecular Biology.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">At our first meeting, we introduced ourselves and reviewed some logistics for the project (e.g., meeting days/dates, tracking hours, getting paid, etc.) as well as the goals and expectations for the project. As a reading assignment, I had students read the chapter on science and exceptionality from a research handbook (McGinnis &amp; Kahn, 2014) in order to gain an overview of the topic. I asked them to consider:</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">I used the time to move (virtually) back and forth between the two rooms to listen to the students. I felt that giving them the time to chat in pairs (in a “Think-Pair-Share” style) would give students the confidence to share with the larger group of four and also would allow students to get to know each other better. We then came back to the larger group and had the pairs share their key takeaways and questions. We also discussed the importance of our virtual room being a safe space for asking questions, taking intellectual risks, and sharing ideas and feedback respectfully.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p9">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">For the following meeting, I asked students to read an article on systematic literature reviews (Alexander, 2020) to give them a sense of the rigor and scope of a quality review. Students were also tasked with using whatever search methods they knew to identify one new article related to science and disability and to upload it in our Google Drive folder. I had students present their articles to each other. After some discussion, I felt confident that we were ready to embark on our research.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p10">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">To get us started, I invited two of our university’s librarians to visit with us in order to orient us to the university’s library holdings and online databases, and to elicit their recommendations for how we might proceed. The librarians first helped us to register for Zotero, the citation management software used by our university. Throughout our project, we used a group Zotero folder in order to share resources, an approach that proved to be quite efficient. The librarians also provided helpful tips for conducting searches, such as using the asterisk “*” for terms like “disab*” to include disability and/or disabilities, considering the range of terms that might prove fruitful for our searches (e.g., disability, special needs, exceptionalities, special education, autism, etc.), and how to narrow our searches. Based on our work with the librarians, we developed a template for the research that my student assistants would use for collecting and summarizing information on the various articles that they read. A sample completed research summary template is included below in Figure 1, while a blank template for readers’ use can be found in Appendix 1. We also used a research log that had been provided to us by one of the librarians so that we could ensure that we weren’t duplicating efforts (Appendix 2).</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">At our next meeting, I tasked each of the students to identify an area of the research within science and exceptionality that was of particular interest to them and to develop research questions around it. To prepare them for this task, we discussed the characteristics of good research questions (e.g., answerable through our research process, novel, interesting, and relevant). At our next meeting, each student shared their questions in pairs and provided feedback to each other. When we came back together as a group, students shared their choices for their questions and agreed to share articles with other students when they encountered items that might be relevant to their peers’ work. Each week that ensued, I had students identify and analyze (by completing the article template) five articles within their research topic and upload them to our shared Google Drive. We then had students present one of their articles each week during our 1 ½ hour meeting. Some weeks, we met twice while other weeks we met once but stayed connected via email. One week, we had an expert colleague in inclusive science education from another university visit us virtually; the student research assistants had read two of the expert’s articles in preparation for the meeting. This was an exciting opportunity as the students had the opportunity to question an author directly on their research. While I attempted to schedule other such visits, I was not able to in the timeframe of our project.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p13">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">One of the most interesting and unexpected discussions that arose during the summer was on the topic of research ethics; specifically, education researchers’ ethical obligations when conducting research on human subjects. While our literature review clearly did not involve human subjects, many of the articles that we read did, and the students in the research group were quick to recognize the safeguards that were described insofar as informed consent by research participants, voluntariness, and so on. I shared some of the history that led to many of these safeguards, such as the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, and I provided students with resources on research ethics and Institutional Review Boards (IRB). I note that, as a demonstration to the students, I also contacted our university’s IRB to confirm that neither our research, nor the development of this article, constituted research on human subjects.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">After six weeks, I asked the students to present an overview of their research on their particular topic. To prepare for this, I gave them the following guiding questions: 1) What is your research topic/question? 2) What are the key findings/themes? 3) What are the gaps in the literature? Students presented to the group for discussion and, by summer’s end, all four students were asking each other questions, providing constructive feedback, and developing competence and confidence in reading, analyzing, and presenting science education research articles. A summary of our internship “curriculum,” which was implemented during ten meetings over six weeks, is outlined below in Table 1. Note that all assessment conducted was informal; suggestions for more formalized assessment are included in the “Recommendations” section of the article.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In high school, I wanted to be a teacher, however coming into college as an engineering major, I have had to push that aspiration to the side for some time. I was primarily interested in this internship because it gave me the opportunity to combine my passion for education with STEM. I also believed that it would open my eyes to alternative ways I could make an impact in the field of education without necessarily becoming a teacher. In all honesty, I didn’t have much knowledge on inclusive science education prior to the internship. This is particularly because inclusive education is not a major topic of discussion in my home country Ghana, much less inclusive science education. Hence this internship was particularly helpful in expanding my knowledge and awareness of issues within this field. For this project, I gathered articles based on the following three research questions: 1) What is the experience of science general and special educators with formal or informal special ed. training with regards to level of preparedness and ability to create and implement inclusive STEM curricula? 2) What are the experiences of K-12 students with disabilities (SWD) attending schools that practice co-teaching between science general ed. and special ed. faculty? 3) What influences SWD interest in learning science and their decision to pursue careers in science?</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">To carry out my research, I started out by using keywords associated with my research questions as search terms in the ERIC database. For example, “Science co-teaching” “in-service teacher education” AND “science” AND “disabilities”, “teacher professional development” AND “science” AND “inclusion.” I also scanned through the references of the articles I selected, to identify other articles that explored my research questions. I also searched through journals such as </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">Journal of Science Education for Students with Disabilities, Journal of Science Education, International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">. Occasionally, I used Google scholar.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">These search results allowed me to identify a number of trends and key takeaways. Firstly, the research showed that student perspectives are very important to consider because sometimes they are very different from teachers perspectives. Additionally, teachers need more support for co-teaching, i.e. given more planning time and more training on co-teaching strategies. Another point that was very clearly highlighted is the fact that special education teachers need more training on science content. A general trend that the articles highlighted was that a lot of teaching strategies for inclusive education focus on the here and now and not on impacting the science identities and interest in science of SWD and gifted students.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Even though the research helped me draw the conclusions above, some questions still remain open. For instance, the dearth of research about co-teaching gifted students makes it an intriguing point for investigation. Is co-teaching just generally not used with gifted students? Or have studies just not been done to investigate its effects? More questions that arose from this research are: What are the science identities of gifted students? Are they interested in pursuing careers in science and if so, what motivates their interest? This last question in particular, is something I couldn’t find a lot of literature in English.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx1.p5">

</li>
</ol>
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">This summary opened my eyes to the fact that people, particularly members of the deaf community, still held traditional stereotypes of scientists as isolated and not sociable and did not see their personalities as matching with a scientist’s personality and these were barriers to pursuing a career in science. It also made me realize that this could be avoided if SWD were taught science with strategies that intended to help SWD envision themselves as future scientists.</span></p>

Most studies either focused on the teacher or student perspectives about co-teaching or training teachers to use strategies other than co-teaching in inclusive science classrooms. Hence, it was interesting to see a study that trained teachers’ in co-teaching, especially since this is an area the teachers claimed to want training in based on the reports from other literature in science co-teaching.</span></p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Grace (third author): Junior, History of Science, and Law</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">I was interested in this research internship because of my academic focus on science as a History of Science major and because of my past experiences working with students with exceptionalities. Before college, I worked as a camp counselor at a summer camp for students with disabilities. This work opened my eyes to the depth of challenges students with disabilities face and the variety of perspectives they have regarding their educational experiences. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked my interest in how scientific knowledge is conveyed and understood, and reinforced in my mind the importance of science education for all. Before starting, I knew very little about inclusive science education. My only knowledge was anecdotal - I had no idea that there was a whole field of inclusive science education research.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">My primary research question during the course of the internship was as follows: What is the current state of laboratory and field trip accessibility and accommodations for students with physical and sensory disabilities in science? I started my research with a broad lens on Google Scholar, then I moved to ERIC and Articles+ from the university library, then, finally, I focused on the references of sources I had already located to find new studies and articles. I searched using key words such as “science lab”, “physical disability”, “science teachers”, “outdoor science”, and “field trip”. I noticed a number of trends in the sources I worked with. First, a wide variety of accommodations, both high-tech and low-tech, exist for students with physical disabilities in science labs and on science field trips. Teacher-initiated adjustment of technological accommodations to suit the needs of individual students has proven crucial in this area. While high-tech accommodations are certainly important in breaking down barriers, simple, low-tech accommodations are also useful, and tend to be more available. In spite of these promising findings, many lab spaces continue to be inaccessible for students with physical disabilities. This is likely due in part to the second major trend I observed: teacher knowledge of available accommodations seems to be lacking, and many schools and districts cannot afford many helpful accommodations. Educators are generally concerned about implementing accessible science experiences into their own schools and programs when they lack administrative support and resources. Further, multiple studies found that science teachers tend to hold biases against students with physical disabilities in science labs and field trips. However, on a positive note, experience working with students with physical disabilities appears to be quite successful in improving teacher perceptions. Third, study in the realm of inclusive science labs and field trips for students with physical disabilities is rather lopsided in terms of age groups and disabilities studied. Much of the research I found was done at the college level or on adults who had previously completed degrees. Additionally, I found a great deal of research on students with visual and hearing impairments, and noticeably less on students with motor impairments and other physical disabilities. Finally, my research pointed to the importance of inclusive labs and field trips. While students with physical disabilities tend not to think of themselves as future career scientists, participating in accessible lab and field trip experiences can show students the path to a potential degree or career in science.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">This study examined the relationship between the completion of hands-on accessible science activities, self-beliefs about one’s capacity for success in science, and inclinations to consider post-secondary science study and science careers in blind and low-vision (BLV) students. Researchers found that, after completing accessible lab activities, BLV students were more likely to express interest in pursuing a higher-education degree and/or a career in science. I found this study to be particularly impactful because it highlighted the role of inclusive science labs in impacting students’ future plans. The study’s findings suggest that accessibility improves not only the real-time experiences of students, but the accessibility of science at higher levels as well. They emphasize the importance of improving inclusive science at every level of education.</span></p>

I was intrigued by this study because it examined teacher perceptions, which may be a significant barrier to the success of students with physical disabilities in science. The researchers’ findings suggest that increased accessibility can impact not only students, but teachers as well. Influencing teacher perceptions has the potential for far-reaching implications, because most teachers instruct multiple groups of students over time.</span></p>

Are certain accommodations more successful for younger science students with physical disabilities? What is the success of tactics applied at the college level in improving lab and field trip experiences for students at the primary and secondary levels? How does co-teaching come into play, specifically in the lab or on field trips? Why does teacher knowledge of accommodations lag behind the accommodations themselves? What is the best way to increase teacher knowledge of accommodations?</span></p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Sean (fourth author): Junior, History of Science/Chemistry, and Medicine</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">I became interested in this internship as a way to challenge myself. Despite dabbling in chemistry and electrical engineering, I’ve always found STEM to be difficult through traditional classroom learning. However, I came to a point where I thought that maybe, I can teach myself STEM through non-traditional ways. But I didn’t know where to start. When I saw that this internship focused on “inclusive science education,” or another way of teaching STEM to both gifted students and students with disabilities, I thought that this would be a great place to learn more about how to teach STEM. I had never heard about “inclusive science education” before I started, but I assumed it was to bring kids with disabilities and kids without disabilities into a classroom where they can cooperate and learn together.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">I first approached this by going through our university library’s database, and scouring the internet for papers using key phrases like “inclusive science education” and “students with disabilities”. Oftentimes, I would read these works and look at their references. I would then work backwards to see not only how well supported their arguments were, but also to expand the breadth of my scope. The trends I saw discussed include ideas from how repetition while studying proves effective in the short term, but doesn’t prove necessarily effective in the long term, and students who were more “creative” in approaching STEM were more engaged and thus did better on tests.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">I’ve had the opportunity to discuss my findings with wonderful people, but my conversation with our internship’s visiting expert sticks out to me. At the time, I was all for inclusive education and talked about how it was a great way to teach STEM. But our visiting expert was able to challenge my ideas, citing his experiences working with students that found inclusive education a mixed bag of results. Through him, I realized that my definition of “success” was different for every person. In other words, in the context of inclusive science education, was success being defined by good test scores? Or was success defined by the likelihood of these students pursuing STEM as future careers?</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx3.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">This internship quickly developed into something more than just learning different ways of teaching STEM. Though my research question focused on figuring out what the best way of teaching and learning STEM was for students with learning disabilities, I saw how my questions bled into the realms of politics, psychology, and especially economics. One report that stands out to me is a work by Lori Andersen and Brooke Nash (2016) of the University of Kansas, where they asked the question of how do we make science accessible to kids with significant cognitive disabilities? Are there biases in administrators as they assess students? Another work by Martha Thurlow, Christopher Rogers, and Laurene Christensen (2010) notes the discrepancy in the level of science education and curriculum across states. But these reports made me realize that educating people seems to be outrageously underfunded by both state and federal levels of government. But the information on where our taxes go seems to be a bit obscured, especially when it comes to education in poorer areas of the United States.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx3.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In all, I found this experience to be very rewarding. It has given me the tools and skills to tackle big questions. It taught me to have courage when taking the plunge down the rabbit hole of confusing and often conflicting blends of information from various fields in society.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">For as long as I can remember, I have always had a passion for science. As a hands-on learner, I am always engaged in science labs during class and try to replicate the things I learn at home. I remember doing experiments with my siblings, which would often result in a mess, but it brought me an inner joy at being able to create extraordinary things out of household objects. My love for science is what first drew me to this internship. However, once I read more about it, I found that I had several other personal connections to it. I was a beneficiary of talented and gifted programs and have a family history of teaching and helping special needs students. Furthermore, I have a passion for education and participate in several initiatives to educate others. I love that this internship combined these various interests in a way that will be used to advance inclusive science practices while maximizing the potential of all learners.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx4.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Before starting this internship, my knowledge of inclusive education mainly consisted of my personal experiences and first-hand accounts from my mom, who works with special needs students. For both gifted students and students with disabilities, I was aware of a lack of inclusive science education; these students learned in separate classrooms, limiting the number of interactions they had with students of diverse educational needs. I knew that intersectionality played a role in exceptional education, but I was not very familiar with the terminology beforehand. I was also aware of the lack of focus on science education for students with special needs. However, I knew there was a lot more for me to learn about inclusive science education, which is another reason I was drawn to this internship. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about the impacts of technologically-enhanced learning on science classrooms for exceptional students and how socioeconomic and racial backgrounds impacted the identification and experiences of exceptional students in science classrooms. Thus, these two topics were the focus of my research.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx4.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">After coming up with my research questions, I brainstormed keywords. I did advanced searches using the databases ERIC, PsycInfo, Google Scholar, and ProQuest as well as our university’s library website. Search terms I used included: “Disabilities,” “gifted,” “science education,” “technology,” “intersectionality,” “socioeconomic status,” “race,” “ethnicity,” “income,” and “demographics.” I recorded my search terms and the databases I used in a research log. After finding articles, I would check the references of those articles to see if there were additional articles or journals I could look into. I went to websites of different journals and did searches there as well. This process enabled me to come across several articles that greatly expanded my knowledge of science education for exceptional students. One article I found particularly interesting was “Sounding Out Science: Using Assistive Technology for Students with Learning Differences in Middle School Science Classes” by Clement Vashkar Gomes and Felicia Moore Mensah (2016). This article introduced me to some of the concepts and theories associated with special education, such as the phonological deficit hypothesis and the disability theory. Furthermore, as a more hands-on learner, I liked how this article focused on teaching science from a different learning style. This study focused on the use of audio technology to help science students with language learning disabilities, so I found it interesting to read about the process of auditory learning. Another article that stood out to me was “The Structural Relationship Between Out-of-School Time Enrichment and Black Student Participation in Advanced Science” by Jamaal Young and Jemimah Young (2018). This article emphasized the importance of out-of-classroom programs in promoting the diversification of science education. When Black students were able to become more engaged in science and participate in hands-on research, they were more inclined to continue their perusal and maintained interest in science. This stood out to me because I have had firsthand experience with the lack of diversity in scientific fields, and this can at least in part be traced back to notions instilled in students from an early age that minorities cannot be successful in science. I appreciate how the researchers of this article strive to debunk this idea. I also liked how this article emphasized the importance of having a support system of family and educators to encourage minority students to pursue STEM.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx4.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">This process enabled me to find several trends in terms of the impacts of technology and intersectionality on science education for exceptional students. Several articles I read emphasized the positive impacts of assistive technology on science education for both gifted students and students with disabilities. However, there are so many different types of technology and technology is always evolving, so this topic requires further research. In terms of intersectionality, a trend was the lack of diversity in STEM; minorities, females, and low socioeconomic status (SES) students pursue STEM less often than other groups of people. However, these underrepresented groups can prosper in science, but need access and support from an early age. Diverse students thrive in science settings that embrace different cultures and reject social norms because this enables these students to use their unique backgrounds as assets instead of barriers.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.SSx4.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Coming into this internship, I had some familiarity with education for exceptional students, but I soon learned that there are so many different aspects of science education for these students that I had never before considered. This research experience has been very eye-opening, and I have learned so many skills that are applicable to research in any discipline.

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">LEARNING FROM STUDENT REFLECTIONS</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In reviewing the student reflections, we believe that we are able to identify some interesting trends. Most notably, each of the students seemed to experience a deepening or refinement of the initial connection they felt to the subject matter. For example, Tiffany’s general interest in teaching became more refined and sparked interest in learning about special education in her home country of Ghana. Similarly, Sean’s own challenges with “traditional” STEM education led him on a journey to identify the “best” way to teach science - a journey that ultimately led him to a more nuanced understanding of the importance of how one operationalizes “best,” or “success.” Courteney noted that she had experienced the lack of diversity in STEM fields firsthand but became more aware of the necessity for STEM educators and education researchers to deepen their understanding of intersectionality and its influence on learner experiences and identities. Finally, Grace’s experience working at a camp for students with disabilities led her to investigate, and ultimately become acutely aware of, the attitudinal, physical, and economic barriers that can limit accessibility to quality educational experiences for students with disabilities. Given that the experience of examining and discussing the existing literature in students’ self-identified areas of interest seemed to expand and enrich students’ connection to inclusive STEM education, it would seem that small literature review groups could become integrated into STEM, STEM education, or SPED programs, either within the curriculum or co-curricularly, in order to develop future teachers, leaders, and engaged citizens who are supportive of quality inclusive STEM education and opportunities for all. This model could be implemented fairly easily if based upon a short learning module comprised of an introduction to education research and literature review serving as its foundation. The “curriculum” we outlined earlier in Table 1 could serve as a foundation to such a module.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx5.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Regarding students’ academic paths, it is interesting to note that both of the history of science majors found interest in policy or systemic issues. Sean’s initial interest in curriculum quickly pivoted to advocacy for increased school funding levels and transparency while Grace’s interest in accessible laboratories and field trips led her to note the critical nature of improving teachers’ perceptions of students with disabilities given each teacher’s impacts on multiple groups of students over long periods of time. Perhaps STEM and special education faculty might find it fruitful to collaborate with colleagues in history, political science, economics, psychology, and pre-law programs to present issues of inclusive STEM education as possible case studies for students in those programs to examine. Capitalizing upon the sweeping and profound connections between inclusive STEM education and other social science fields might prove beneficial for all students who plan to tackle thorny policy-level and system-wide challenges in their careers.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx5.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Finally, we note that, based on the students’ current career goals, this internship may have equipped two future doctors, a lawyer, and an engineer with increased awareness of the educational, policy, and societal barriers and facilitators influencing inclusive and equitable STEM education…an outcome that would not have ordinarily arisen from their existing academic programs. One can easily envision these future professionals treating, advocating for, and designing for students with exceptionalities in their careers. Moreover, given that approximately 25% of the adult U.S. population volunteers time outside of their careers, and approximately 26% of volunteers work in the education sector (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016), developing future leaders in all fields who have awareness of the challenges and opportunities for inclusive STEM education may prove impactful through both vocational and avocational tracts.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx6.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">We believe that our research group proved to be a successful venture for all involved. Each of the student research assistants gained understanding of the need for increased research on, and support for, quality inclusive science education. The students also each voiced interest in advocating for equitable STEM education in the future, regardless of their career paths. This project outcome was particularly gratifying as it has the potential to address societal biases that continue to hamper persons with disabilities’ pursuit of STEM vocations. Participation in our group also provided students with valuable experience and skills that will serve them in their future studies and possibly their careers. Of course, the college administrator also benefited tremendously from the research group in that she learned about the students’ experiences during the summer of COVID-19, gained student insights about inclusive science literature, and honed skills for communicating about inclusive science education with non-educators/non-education majoring students.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">While literature reviews are typically done to understand what is known in a particular field in preparation for making original research contributions to that field (Jesson, et al., 2011), we were unable to find research on the use of literature review development as pedagogy for the purpose of teaching non-researchers (and in this case, non-education students) about a field such as inclusive science education. Perhaps research in this area is warranted to determine whether students show measureable differences in knowledge and awareness of, sensitivity to, and intentions to act on the area of study after literature review (both individual and collaborative) experiences. We, of course, realize that bias may have played a role in the positive feedback received from the student participants who had been employed during the internship; however, we reiterate that the purpose of the present article was not research but rather, to share preliminary findings from what we believe was a positive practitioner experience.</span></p>

In addition, three of the students presented their research findings at our university’s research day. Thus far, our research has identified over 150 articles, chapters, and books related to inclusive science education. More importantly, it has inspired a small group of future leaders toward the practical and moral imperative for inclusive, equitable, and excellent STEM for all.</span></p>
