<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Increased student diversity in classrooms and the need for equitable STEM opportunities for all, creates an impetus for educators to establish inclusive and equitable environments and use teaching practices that facilitate meaningful learning for all students in science education. This article offers a three-part framework for combining inclusive philosophy, the science and engineering practices, and Universal Design for Learning (UDL). The article is intended to help teachers and teacher educators universally design science education to level the science learning field through access and equity for all students, including students with disabilities. We advocate for the use of four practices: creating an inclusive community of science learners, planning for big ideas over time, engaging students in sense-making through model-based inquiry, and engaging students in cooperative learning and science talk. Science teachers can use these practices to universally design science education and enhance science learning and STEM interest for underrepresented students. In the article, we provide visuals and tools for teachers to support implementation of the universally designed science practices.</span>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Consider the following vignette.</span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;"> Mrs. Robinson is a new teacher in a diverse middle school. She was assigned an inclusive science class that includes students with various cultural backgrounds, socioeconomic and disability status. She has four students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) including one student with an autism label, one student with an intellectual disability label, and two students with learning disability labels (dyslexia and dyscalculia), as well as two students with 504 plans for untimed tests. She was struggling to meet everyone’s needs and began thinking about equitable and accessible practices to meaningfully integrate and engage all students in her classroom.</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Mrs. Robinson’s question is common among teachers: How do I meet the standards and meet the needs of all of my students? Every teacher must be prepared to address the increasing diversity of learners in their classrooms and content areas (National Center for Education Statistics, 2019). The inequity in learning outcomes between students with and without identified disabilities places a high priority on best instructional practices that facilitate meaningful access for all students in science education. We advocate beginning with an ideological foundation that presumes student competence (Jorgensen, 2005). The lack of effective instruction and lowered academic expectations both lead to poor science learning outcomes for students with disabilities (Horowitz, et al., 2017). Meanwhile, positive classroom climates and inclusive and equitable teaching practices positively correlate with enhanced students’ performance and engagement in STEM careers (C-abrera et al., 2001). Inclusive pedagogies such as student-centered approaches, inquiry-based instruction (Windschitl &amp; Barton, </span>
<br class="ltx_break"/><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">2016), and UDL (Meyer, et al., 2014) can be used to design inclusive classroom environments and instruction and work to address the opportunity gap (Ladson-Billings, 2013).</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In this section, we outline a conceptual framework that includes three components for universally designing science education with three guiding questions. The components with their guiding questions represented in Figure 1 include: 1. Inclusive philosophy (what teachers believe); 2. Science and engineering practices (what teachers teach); and 3. Universal Design for Learning (how teachers do it). We argue that in order to achieve a more cohesive practice of universally designed science education, these components must be used in combination, and science teachers must have a good working understanding about how each component contributes to the overall goal of supporting all students with science learning. From there, teachers can use these components to make informed pedagogical decisions about how to best deliver science specific content and meet the needs of all of their students.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Science education has long framed learning “as engagement with scientific practices” (Brickhouse et al., 2000, p.441). Literature also indicates that some students with disabilities experience science learning as inaccessible with one reason being the extensive amount of academic language involved in science lessons and the inductive and deductive thinking required for scientific reasoning (Mastro-pieri et al., 2006). Science learning also requires students to make sense of observable phenomena, abstract concepts, and complex science practices including controlled experimentation, data collection, and data analysis (Puttick &amp; Mutch-Jones, 2015). The perceived difficulty of science subject matter has contributed to limiting access to the general education science curriculum for many students with disabilities. Consequently, students with disabilities are underrepresented in STEM fields due to the lack of meaningful independent experience, low expectations, and limited educational opportunities (Dunn et al., 2012). Furthermore, classroom community and the design of the learning environment are key factors in shaping students’ science identities and supporting the shift from a sense that "science is not for me” to a sense of science expert (Windschitl &amp; Barton, 2016, p. 1119). Known exclusions from the science curriculum, and within the discipline more broadly, underscore the need for more flexible, inclusive, and student-centered approaches to science teaching.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Windschitl and Barton (2016) discuss this instructional gap as follows:</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p4">
<blockquote class="ltx_quote">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The aspects of instruction known to support engagement and learning— such as maintaining an environment of high expectations, responding to student thinking, and linking activity with science ideas and with the out-of-school experiences of young learners—are precisely where classroom teaching appears weakest (p. 1102).</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Additionally, Universal Design for Learning resea-rch supports that learners need to be actively engaged in learning experiences and provided opportunities for choice in educational activities (Meyer et al., 2014). The multiple means of engagement principle of UDL aims to tap into students’ interests, challenge them, and motivate them to learn (CAST, 2018). Thus, the UDL framework is well aligned to calls for improving science teaching as identified by the science education field. Following is a detailed discussion about each of the specific components of our proposed framework supported by relevant literature and contextualized with growing examples explained through vignettes.</span></p>
</div>
<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx3.SSx1">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Component 1: Inclusive Philosophy (What Teachers Believe)</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">Elijah Ditchendorf was a student transitioning from elementary to middle school who self-ide-ntified as dyslexic, had an IEP, and was an active member of his IEP planning team. Ditchendorf and his family were told by his sixth grade science teacher that he could not be recommended for accelerated science in middle school because “I had reached his full potential. Midway through seventh grade, my accelerated ma-th teacher said, ‘Why aren’t you in accelerated science?’ I said, they didn’t think I was smart enough.” (National Center for Learning Disabilities, 2017, n.p.). Mrs. Robinson’s proactive effort to meet the needs of all of her students may prevent a student like Elijah from being excluded.</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">
</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Elijah’s story demonstrates the critical importance of understanding disability beyond educational labels and deficit-driven perspectives that may justify limiting students’ learning opportunities in sc-hool. Disability studies in education (DSE) offers educators an opportunity to expand their goals as inclusive educators by intentionally disrupting inequities. For teachers this could include, presuming competence, maintaining high expectations, a-nd ensuring access to and engagement with rigorous academics. Koomen and colleagues (2018) urge listening to the voices of students as experts of inclusion “who tell us in their own words what practices really work best for them in an inclusive classroom” (p. 363). Centering disabled voices and students’ experiences is also a specific aim of the field of disability studies and is an integral part of changing perceptions of disability in education by honoring individuals with disabilities as the authorities of their own lived experiences (Ferguson &amp; Nusbaum, 2012). The impact of teachers’ perceptions of disability is illustrated by the disparate outcomes that came because of the different beliefs held by Elijah’s sixth and seventh grade science teachers.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">We start our discussion about inclusive philosophy by first recognizing the legal underpinning for inclusive education for students in U.S. schools. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (1997) mandated that students with disabilities receive a “free appropriate public education” in the "least restrictive environment." According to the law, students with disabilities must be provided with supplemental aids and services to support an appropriate education, with the expectation that students who receive special education services are included in the general education classroom as often as possible. Furthermore, the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Endrew Decision created a higher substantive standard for determining ‘meaningful educational benefit’ with an expectation that most students will be fully integrated and make meaningful progress in the general education curriculum, and that progress will be reflected in the student’s IEP (Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District, 2017). We recognize inclusive education as a student right and the responsibility of all teachers.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Practices of inclusive education intentionally grounded in DSE and aligned with critical pedagogy, multiculturalism, and social justice in schools, can create welcoming general education classrooms responsive to disability and difference (Baglieri, 2017). To achieve the aims of inclusive education, we need to address how students are excluded from the science curriculum. As a starting point, DSE shifts conceptualizations about students such that "students with diverse learning needs are not the problem; barriers in the curriculum itself are the root of the difficulty" (Hitchcock, et al., 2002, p.9).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Practitioners need to understand meaningful inclusion in order to avoid the risk of exclusion even when students with disabilities are physically present in classrooms. As Ferri (2006) stated, “students can be physically included but not conceptually included in the mind of the teacher” (p. 292). Meaningful inclusion responds to students’ individual needs and interests through a true sense of belonging in a supportive community, rather than positioning students’ needs as a burden. With this understanding, we can move beyond promoting one way of teaching based on the “myth of the normal child” (Baglieri et al., 2011, p. 2124). In inclusive education, students with disabilities and neurodiverse students (Armstrong, 2018) should not be expected to learn the same thing, in the same way, at the same pace, and produce the same product, but instead be provided flexible engagement and assessment opportunities.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx1.p6">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">For any inclusive educator, practicing meaningful inclusion and developing an inclusive classroom community involves both an ideological commitment to support students with disabilities and the implementation of research-based practices (Ferguson &amp; Nusbaum, 2012). Presuming students competence and using stren-gths-based approaches are foundational to the rigorous work needed around achieving equity in science education and accepting diversity as a norm rather than an exception (Tsu et al., 2014). Strengths-based IEPs should be implemented with the purpose of sustaining high expectations and encouraging students to reach hi-gher levels of academic achievement through str-engths-based services, supports, and goals (Elder et al., 2018). The design of learning experiences should honor students’ sense-making repertoires with various ways of reasoning and communicating as well as value and respond to their voices, experiences, funds of knowledge, and perspectives (Gay &amp; Kirkland, 2003). It is essential "to ensure that individual differences do not mitigate access and engagement" (Edyburn, 2010, p.36). Therefore, science teaching strategies must be designed to improve curriculum accessibility and engagement for all students, and improve learning outcomes inclusive of, and with the attention to the value that students’ diverse experiences, abilities, language, and cultural backgrounds bring to the science classroom.</span></p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Component 2: Science and Engineering Practices (What Teachers Teach)</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">Mrs. Robinson is thinking about her science units and how to link them to topics that are interesting to her students to enhance their engagement. She asks herself about the important observable and relevant phenomena that students should understand and how they can represent a model that could help them make sense of the unit’s big ideas. For example, in the sound energy unit, she could use a video of a singer whose voice makes a glass break as an anchoring event to get her students thinking about the cause of this phenomenon, the concept of sound as energy, the characteristics of sound waves, and resonance. Then her students will construct an explanatory model and argue from evidence to show the concepts and conditions involved.</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The science and engineering practices draw from reform-based science teaching that employs st-udent-centered inquiry. The science standards encompass both the framework for science education (National Research Council, 2012) and the NGSS (2013) with its three dimensions: science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts of science, and disciplinary core ideas. These dimensions aim to help students improve their understanding and use of scientific knowledge, ideas, and inquiry processes and their application in real-world situations. According to Ambitious Science Teaching, (Windschitl et al., 2018) science education is guided by four core practices: (a) planning for engagement with big science ideas, (b) eliciting students’ ideas, (c) supporting ongoing changes in thinking, and (d) drawing together evidence-based explanations. Educational research has demonstrated the effectiveness of an inquiry-based approach providing opportunities for hands-on learning and group interaction that can create high interest and alternative ways for students with disabilities to understand the real world (Mastropieri &amp; Scruggs, 2005).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Teaching aligned to the NGSS (2013) requires a shift away from presenting information for memorization to supporting students’ explorat-ions of phenomena through the process of building models, providing explanations, and using evidence to support their thinking (Krajcik &amp; Mun, 2014). Concerningly, there is a tendency to accommodate students with disabilities by relying on teachers and peers to accomplish hig-her order thinking activities. This occurs when teachers assume that students are unable to meet rigorous standards and engage in inquiry, rather than developing supports that encourage autonomy, as the major adaptation (Kahn, et al., 2017). The goal of inclusive science instruction is not to make science content easier by watering it down, but rather as Ellis (1997) argues by actively “watering up” the curriculum so that all students have opportunities for deep learning and thinking. There are various effective, research-based instructional models readily available within science teaching that are grounded in active participation and that can empower students toward equitable performance outcomes These models include the inquiry continuum: confirmation inquiry, structured inquiry, guided inquiry, and open inquiry </span>
<br class="ltx_break"/><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">(Banchi &amp; Bell, 2008) and the 5E model: engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate (Bybee, et al., 2006). Guided-inquiry approaches are demonstrated to have effective outcomes for students with disabilities (Aydeniz et al., 2012).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The NGSS (2013) aim to engage all students in conceptual thinking by “doing science” involving the content and the process of science learning (Kang &amp; Zinger, 2019; Penuel &amp; Reiser, 2018). The NGSS (2013) demonstrate a comprehensive vision of inclusive science for underrepresented groups, including students with disabilities and preparing all students for STEM-related college studies or careers. Appendix D in NGSS (2013) presents effective classroom strategies with diverse student groups capitalizing on their cultures as valuable resources and connecting their background knowledge with science learning (Januszyk et al., 2016). Such strategies help “students of all backgrounds to deeply understand fundamental science ideas, participate in the practices of science, solve authentic problems together, and learn how to continue learning on their own” (Windschitl et al., 2018, p. 3). All of these expected outcomes can support an inclusive universally designed approach to science learning.</span></p>

<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx3.SSx3">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Component 3: Universal Design for Learning (How Teachers Can Do It) </h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">To proactively design UDL-aligned lessons, Mrs. Robinson should first know her students including their interests, strengths, needs, talents, lived experiences, and the community and cultural knowledge that they bring to the classroom. Next, she needs to pinpoint barriers in the curriculum that impede engagement and progress for any student and plan for ways to make the goals, materials, instructional methods, and assessments inclusive through flexible, accessible, and engaging learning experiences. For example, Mrs. Robinson plan-ned for multiple means of representation by building in the option for all students to access scientific information thr-ough digital text. The opportunity for visual access and text-to-speech conversion met her students’ stated needs in the areas of reading decoding and reading comprehension, but also potentially created access points that benefit other students as well. For example, English language learners may benefit from the language tools afforded by the use of digital texts, and/or students for whom listening comprehension is a strength could have the option to increase the audio reading speed. Mrs. Robinson has also planned to help all students access content from textbooks or lectures by activating prior knowledge through questions and scaffolds, providing multiple examples, highlighting important information, and offering adjustable levels of challenge using flexible groupings.</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Universal Design for Learning was developed by the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) in the early 1990s as a research-based framework based on neuroscience and cognitive-social learning. It evolved into an educational model that consists of designing educational go-als, methods, materials, and assessments to improve accessibility. Like science education, UDL (Meyer et al., 2014) recognizes the need for student engagement in purposefully varied ways with attention to eliminating access barriers fr-om the outset. The UDL framework is organized around three principles: 1. Multiple mea-ns of representation; 2. Multiple means of action and expression; and 3. Multiple means of engagement. These principles are also often discussed as the “what” of learning, the “how” of learning, and the “why” of learning respectively. In brief, the three principles involve providing information in multi-modal ways (representation); providing students with options to participate in learning activities and demonstrate what they have learned (action and expression); and motivating students through choice, experience, and real-life application (engagement).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">All of the principles are organized through checkpoints designed for students to access learning, build skills, and internalize strategies toward developing learners who are resourceful and knowledgeable, strategic and goal-oriented, and purposeful and motivated (CAST, 2018). “Universal Design for Learning focuses on building supports proactively into lesson goals, curriculum resources, instructional practices, and assessments” (Ok et al., 2016, p. 1). However, before designing lessons or learning activities, it is first necessary to know your students by assessing their prior knowledge, interests, and needs. This critical first step allows teachers to plan purposefully for their students. The next step is to identify any known or potential barriers to learning for all students. At this point, a teacher is ready to consider how they will teach specific science skills or concepts using flexible goals, materials, methods, and assessments for students (see Figure 2).</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx3.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">This framework is similar to differentiated instruction that also uses these three planning steps for individual students or groups of students across the areas of content, process, product, and learning environment (Tomlinson, 2001). However, in UDL the focus shifts away from individual students or groups of students to the design of the learning environment and instruction by proactively removing any barriers. This framework shapes equitable attitudes and practices for all students, rather than focusing on students with identified disabilities. Watt and colleagues (2013) identify how UDL and science education are well aligned stating that, “as part of UDL, providing a range of supports and a systematic way for students to organize and make connections, even within an inquiry-based classroom is a perfect marriage for success of students with a range of needs” (p. 41). Thus, a range of supports for students should draw on research-based and evidence-based practices including universally designed tools and assistive technologies. Research shows that educational “technology holds significant promise for improving scientific learning opportunities for students with disabilities” (Marino, 2010, p.6). Many technologies such as touch screens, voice dictation, text to speech, captioning, and word prediction began as ways to assist students with disabilities, but can be beneficial to all students. Digital science teaching tools, such as the ones we present in Table 2 below, are another form of assistive technologies that can offer flexibility, access, and communication options for the science classroom.</span></p>

Big ideas are the intended goals that provide a conceptual and relational understanding of science concepts. Clearly communicating learning goals and big ideas to students encourages them to “focus, self-regulate, and monitor their levels of cognitive, emotional, and physical engagement” (Basham &amp; Marino, 2013, p.11). Teachers should present academic language and big ideas toward the goal of developing meaningful connections and conversations about their learning (Watt et al., 2013). In addition, teachers should explicitly teach academic language as a means to reduce barriers related to lack of background knowledge about new scientific concepts. Therefore, providing options that supply or activate prerequisite information is critical. Such options include (CAST, 2018):</span></p>

For this purpose, teachers can create concept maps to pinpoint the unit activities building toward the big ideas and the narrative storyline of a unit (Puttick &amp; Mutch-Jones, 2015). This helps students construct sophisticated ideas using evidence that builds on their prior understanding as they engage in explaining phenomena. Thinking about big ideas and making connections between practices and activities using a storyline, students can gradually develop integrated understanding to reach the level of expected proficiency and avoid compartmental understanding (Krajcik &amp; Mun, 2014). These big ideas need to be built over time for students to make connections to different science concepts, revise, and improve their understanding while being engaged in sense-making investigations.</span></p>

She engages her students through phenomena, such as salt and sugar dissolving in the food, phone charging using electricity, and clothes clinging on bodies. All of her students are more likely to relate to these concrete real-world events and be motivated to ask new questions that they identify as necessary to construct models and explanations of phenomena. In this way, Mrs. Robinson’s teaching allows for applied learning rather than isolated or decontextualized concept understanding.</span></p>

The results of this engaged process allow students to develop more refined and scientifically accurate understandings of the natural world. Engaging in scientific modeling also allows students to visualize abstract concepts, such as energy and force. Additional resources about model-based practices, as well as practical planning and scaffolding tools are available online through Ambitious Science Teaching (Ambitious Science Teaching Development Group, 2020). For many students with disabilities supplementing the inquiry process with specific structure, and explicit instruction and feedback may be most successful (Watt et al., 2013). Teachers should also adjust the level of challenge presented to all students without reducing challenging learning opportunities for students with disabilities. An important part of the process is building in opportunities for students to actively reflect, assess, and self-monitor their learning and engagement (Summy &amp; Fetters, 2018).</span></p>

These kinds of inclusive and culturally responsive learning opportunities with science content can generate students’ interests in STEM-related college studies and careers (Jan-uszyk et al., 2016). The major goal of science education is to “provide all students with the background to systematically investigate issues related to their personal and community priorities” (National Research Council, 2012, p. 278).

From a universal design approach, cooperative learning strategies allow students to work together to find solutions to scientific issues to ensure active participation and engagement of all students (Scruggs et al., 2007). Students working in pairs or groups draw on their prior knowledge, allows them to debate different ideas, and encourages them to seek additional information to extend their understanding and generate solutions (Kuhn, 2015). Use of cooperative learning activities in a supportive learning environment creates conditions whereby students learn from each other and become social and academic peer support partners to reach a common learning goal (Guðjónsdóttir &amp; Óskarsdóttir, 2016). Thus, collaborative learning designed through inquiry-based science provides a strengths-based and student-centered way for students to make progress toward shared learning goals.</span></p>

Using science talk protocol provides a universally designed way for students to theorize together, promotes equitable conversation, and builds literacy skills. In fact, “the ultimate goal of science talk is to create a discourse-rich classroom culture where the natural synergy between language and meaning making supports all students in expressing ideas, developing language and acquiring new knowledge of scientific phenomena” (Exploratorium, 2021). The Ambitious Science Teaching Development Group (2020) offers a protocol for teachers wondering, “How do I begin to shift my classroom culture away from right answers towards collaborative knowledge construction talk?” Exchange of ideas around problem solving stimulates science talk that plays an important role in prompting and supporting students’ scientific sense-making based on observations, claim, and evidence. In a safe and welcoming classroom environment, “together, strong norms, predictable routines, and strategic scaffolding enable talk to flourish” (Windschitl et al., 2018, p.65). Engaging in scientific discourse and practices of science offers a rich language-learning opportunity for students and an opportunity to leverage community discourse (National Research Council, 2012).</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Given opportunities to engage in inquiry-based activities, express themselves in a safe environment, and demonstrate their learning in varied ways through choice and agency, students become more interested and motivated in science learning. Universally designed science instruction promotes higher levels of academic and social learning, as well as supports students in seeing themselves like scientists and capable in the STEM field. Implementing universally designed science education most successfully involves both ideological and pedagogical changes by educators. As such, it is a social justice process that can be nurtured by normalizing and valuing difference, removing barriers to learning, and tapping into the strengths and unique expertise diverse students bring to the classroom. By creating an inclusive community of science learners, planning for big ideas, engaging students in sense-making through model-based inquiry, and utilizing cooperative learning with science talk, science teachers can create more effective access points to science education. We hope that this article supports teachers and practitioners with universally designing science education that will contribute to the aims of social justice-centered science teaching and learning.</span></p>
