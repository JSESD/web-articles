activities, and provides suggestions for increasing accessibility for students with disabilities. We
focused on GLOBE (Global Learning Observations to Benefit the Environment) protocols, specifically
the new Seasons and Biomes investigation currently being developed as part of the GLOBE program.
Five university students with disabilities majoring in science or technology were recruited to test the GLOBE protocols, and 10 protocols were evaluated for accessibility. Based on our results, we make
several suggestions with regards to instructions, equipment, safety, outcomes and activity significance that will increase the accessibility of GLOBE and all K-16 science methods</span>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Persons with disabilities account for 20% of the U.S. population, but only make up 7% of the science and engineering workforce, compared to 14% of the entire U.S. labor force (National Science Foundation, 2004). The emphasis on (and the physical challenges of) field research in geology, geophysics, meteorology, atmospheric science, oceanography, soil science, planetary science, and environmental science may be one cause of this underrepresentation (Locke, 2005). In addition, there may be a lack of exposure to field sciences in high school as well as a limited awareness of career options (Locke, 2005).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Science classrooms frequently do not provide the instructional supports that students with disabilities need, and there are clear indications that students with disabilities are not being provided with equal opportunity for science learning. Access to science educational materials for persons with disabilities is critical for ensuring a future workforce qualified to address the continuing challenges in environmental applications and research, and to encourage the future participation of persons with disabilities in field sciences.
This project focused on GLOBE (Global Learning Observations to Benefit the Environment) protocols, specifically the new Seasons and Biomes investigation currently being developed as part of the GLOBE program, as a cooperative effort between by the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, International Arctic Research Center (IARC) and the NASA LandSat Data Continuity (LDCM) and Terra Satellite Missions. GLOBE encourages and promotes science in the classroom by providing students with the opportunity to collect scientifically valid measurements in the fields of atmosphere, hydrology, soils, and land cover/phenology and report their data through the Internet. Data from GLOBE students around the world are collected and stored on the GLOBE data archive for use by student and scientists.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Seasons and Biomes is an inquiry and projectbased initiative that monitors seasons, specifically interannual variability, in order to increase understanding of earth systems science. The project focuses on using existing and new GLOBE protocols to monitor seasonal environmental changes that occur in the major earth biomes. Students monitor their own biomes’ seasons through field work, and gain insights into the connections between climate variations, soils, and vegetation phenology. Existing GLOBE monitoring protocols will be used to measure environmental properties including soil and air temperature, soil moisture, precipitation, and phenology. New protocols are also being developed for measurements of freshwater ice, depth of soil freezing, mosquitoes and others relating to specific biomes.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The purpose of this research was to evaluate the accessibility of the Seasons and Biomes protocols for students with disabilities. This research is an important first step in reducing barriers to the participation, retention and advancement of students with disabilities in field science disciplines. In the long-term, this effort should increase the representation of students with disabilities in college science majors, and increase the number of people capable of working in science-related careers.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Although this study was specific to the GLOBE protocols, our results are applicable to all K-16 field and laboratory science activities.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">METHODOLOGY AND RESEARCH PROCEDURES</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">We tested 10 GLOBE protocols (www.globe.gov) for accessibility, including Bud burst, Clouds, Precipitation, Green up/Green down, Soil fertility, Soil particle distribution, Ice phenology, GPS measurement, Soil particle density and Soil pH. Five (5) University of Southern Maine students with disabilities majoring in science or technology were recruited to test the GLOBE protocols. Their disabilities are profiled in Appendix A. The students were asked to review the protocols and collect data.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">They were videotaped and asked to fill out a questionnaire at the end of data collection.</span></p>
</div>

<section class="ltx_section" id="Sx3">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">RESULTS</h2>
<section class="ltx_subsection" id="Sx3.SSx1">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection" style="font-size:120%;">Instructions and Instructional Design and Layout</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.SSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">All GLOBE protocols (methods) and data sheets need to be formatted using a standard design that is consistent. Students with disabilities, especially those with processing and functioning disabilities have difficulty moving from one protocol to the next when layout and design are not consistent. If protocol designs are consistent then students will have greater success because they are familiar with the design of the exercise, even if they are not familiar with the content. For example, the students who tested the protocols felt that each protocol should begin with a statement that sets the context of the experiment – why are conducting these experiments, or collecting these data important? What will the data be used for? Examples of how these data are used by scientists or other classrooms are very important to set the stage for the experiment. The second item in each protocol should be a vocabulary list, and the third item should be a list of equipment needed, with illustrations. Care should be taken to ensure that the equipment list is complete, but contains no extras. Students with disabilities are often very literal. For example, if a pencil is not included on the list of equipment they will not bring one. Similarly, if there is a piece of equipment on the list that is not needed, they will become very distracted attempting to determine the purpose of the extra equipment. The fourth item in the protocol should be a bulleted list of instructions. Included in the instructions needs to be contingency plans – what to do if a measurement is not as expected, if a piece of equipment fails, etc. All protocols and equipment should consistently use SI units.</span></p>
</div>
</section>
</section>
<section class="ltx_section" id="Sx4">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">EQUIPMENT INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Similarly, care should be taken to ensure that instructions that accompany equipment are consistent with any equipment instructions given in the protocols. If students are expected to use the instructions that accompany the equipment, they should be physically accessible and follow the format discussed below for protocols. One page equipment “cheat sheets” should also be developed and used in place of equipment manuals. Thus, students are only required to understand the relevant equipment use instructions. Also, these cheat sheets should include information on the accuracy and precision of the equipment, such that the students are comfortable with the data they are collecting.</span></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ltx_section" id="Sx5">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">DATA SHEETS</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The data sheets also need to be consistent between protocols. There should be only one data table per protocol, and only one protocol per data table. Some type of coding/prompt needs to be used such that it is very clear as to when data needs to be recorded, and exactly where it needs to be recorded on the data sheet. Color coding is often useful in these situations, but classroom teachers may not have access to color printers, and some students have difficulties seeing color. Data sheets should have no extra spaces, and should not ask for extra data beyond which is specified in the protocol. Similarly, if a photograph is required as part of the data collection process, the directions need to be very specific regarding the level of detail required in the photograph. Some type of summary data table might also be useful, to assist the students in processing the data collected in its entirety</span></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="ltx_section" id="Sx6">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">PROTOCOL DESIGN</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx6.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In designing the protocols care should be taken to avoid wordiness and long dense text passages. Students benefit from bulleted instructions that are clear, but brief, with an explicit workflow. Students with disabilities often get bogged down with long text blocks, and appreciate white space on the page. However, all vocabulary should be clearly defined, and abbreviations should never be used unless accompanied by the full term. Again, students with processing and memory disabilities have difficulties remembering the meanings of abbreviations from one sentence to the next. Using bullets, bold font, colors and graphics are helpful, as long as the use is consistent between protocols. The use of visual cues, such as photographs or graphics to illustrate key concepts, experimental steps or vocabulary is especially helpful. There are standard guidelines for fonts, sizes, colors, contrast, known as </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">maximum legibility</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;"> and also on the use of </span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="font-size:120%;">plain language</span><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">. Maximum legibility is based on specific dimensions of the appearance of written material. Maximum legibility characteristics have been defined for specific dimensions (Table 1) (Thompson, Johnston, and Thurlow, 2002). “Plain language” writing means making choices in the way you write in order to communicate information quickly and efficiently. It is a very useful way to communicate critical, important information to a diversity of people (Brown, 1999). Plain language strategies are presented in Table 2.</span></p>

Traditional compasses, similar to analog clocks are very hard for students with processing disorders to use, and all schools should consider adopting the use of digital compasses. In general, all equipment should be specified as digital, rather than analog. Not only are digital equipment readouts better for students with learning disabilities, they can also be adapted such that voice “announcement” of data is possible, thereby making them accessible to students with visual disabilities. GPS units differ greatly between manufactures’. Therefore, schools should be consistently specify a certain manufacturer and model number, and also develop a detailed instruction sheet on GPS use. The complexity of the GPS units for first time users was very frustrating, and set a negative tone for the remainder of the protocol data collection. Frustration levels are also high if students are forced to deal with English versus metric conversions, so all protocols, data and equipment should consistently use SI units.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx7.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Teachers also need to be aware that students with fine and gross motor skill disabilities have problems handling small pieces of equipment. Care should be taken to provide equipment with lanyards and padded cases. Also, most equipment may be purchased in various sizes, and larger is always better for students with motor skill disabilities</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">SAFETY</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx8.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Safety is an issue with all science activities, and safety issues range from standard safety equipment such as eye protection to working with one or more partners (“buddy system”). Another issue is that of safely and securely handling and transporting field equipment and instrumentation. For example, lanyards should be used for equipment to prevent the dropping and breaking of delicate instruments, and all equipment should have appropriately padded and protective cases in the event that a piece of equipment is dropped.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx8.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">For students with disabilities, in general, and especially those with motor function disabilities, whether fine motor skills or more profound motor difficulty, it is critical that the students be made to feel comfortable both in terms of their own safety and the safety and security of equipment and instrumentation for which they are responsible. In order to promote and sustain students’ interest in the STEM areas, especially in field-based research, ensuring student safety and comfort should be a top priority</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">EXPECTATIONS AND RESULTS</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx9.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Successfully working with scientific data is a critical skill. Students like the opportunity to create and use data arrayed in tables. Generating scientific results is very satisfying to the students. It is important to emphasize consistency and accuracy in the results. One issue that has emerged is that of estimation. In the completed protocols, there were results that were significantly out of range (orders of magnitude) from the correct or reasonable result. Students need to be presented some examples and or training regarding estimation and approximation.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx9.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">When the students must work in the open natural environment and have no single expectation to bear in mind it is appropriate for the students to be given an overview of the type of result as well as a range or size of the result. Overall, the students need to achieve a focus on the scope of the protocol so they do not get distracted or enmeshed in false starts and or the commitment of significant amounts of time and energy that take them in unproductive activities/directions.

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The results of this research provide important first steps in reducing barriers to the participation, retention and advancement of students with disabilities in field science disciplines. Based on the findings from our data, these are steps that can be taken to increase the accessibility of GLOBE protocols for students with disabilities. These suggestions will also help in increasing the accessibility of all K-16 science methods.</span></p>
